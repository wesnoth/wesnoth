This directory contains tools to help analyze header dependencies.

The first script is "build_headers". It runs clang with -H option,
to generate header dependencies, over the entire source directory,
and builds out of tree copies of all files with a listing of all
headers they directly or indirectly include. You may run it with
various filters for level of detail.

Build headers will generate a sorted "rank" file which indicates
how many compilation units include each header.

The second script is "header_times". It takes a compilation log,
generated by scons with debug=time option (such as found on
travis), and builds a second ranking in which compilation units
are weighted by the total time that they take.

	wesnoth ``data/core" directory.

1.0.1
	* The plugin has it's own webpage: http://eclipse.wesnoth.org
	* Created the standalone version of the plugin. It is available on plugin's webpage.
	* Fixed the file associations for .map files. Now the game editor will be the default one.
	* Optimized the building by not reloading the macros cache if no config files have been modified.
	* The plugin is now signed.
	* Enhanced the documentation.
	* Added tooltip to each preference in preferences page.
	* Added marker support when checking with wmllint and wmlscope. The markers will appear
	in each file, at the reported line and in the Problems Pane (usually the one under the editor)
	* The user is asked at the workspace setup phase whether to create or not projects for 
	mainline projects
	* Fixed a problem when an empty project won't open after creating it.
	* Fixed bug #16602.
	* Fixed bug #16984 - The path for python executable can now be set via preferences page.
1.0.0
	* Fixed a problem in cases when the workbench isn't started and the
	  welcome message would have caused error starting the plugin
	* Now it's possible to use a wesnoth project without the 'build.xml' build files.
	  If the build.xml file is missing the user can 'regenerate' it by using the
	  project's context menu. A file without 'build.xml' is considered to be
	  a data/campaigns/ project
	* Added 'Advanced Preferences' preferences page.
	* Removed the User Addons project
	* The 'Setup workspace" action will create a project for each existing
	  data/campaigns/ campaign and for each directory in 'useraddons/data/add-ons'
	* Wesnoth projects building was improved by:
		- removing some unused properties
		- caching of preprocessed files. Files that already have been preprocessed will be skipped.
		- the project macros are read only at the end of the build
	* The *.map files are opened automatically in the game map editor
	* The grammar was updated so the editor will support a broader variety of wml code.
	  Even though, the current grammar has 2 unsupported WML Constructs:
	  1) Attributes with the key name as a macro: (an example: Dead Water campaign/utils/dw-utils.cfg:70)
		{name}=id
	  2) Unterminated/unstarted tags. This is used sometimes in macro definitions.
		(example: Delfadors Memoirs/scenarios/09_Houses_of_the_Undead.cfg, the first 2 macros defined)

		#define macro_start
			[unit]
				id=myunit
		#enddef
		...
		#define macro_end
			[/unit]
		#enddef

		As a resolve to this issue you could write/re-write the macro so instead of having 2 macros
		you would have only one + 1 extra argument that will represent the content replaced in between

	* When there are tags that need to be closed, when the user types: '[/' the last
	  unclosed tag will be closed automatically
	* The user can specify whether the new project wizard should create the files:
	  '_server.pbl' and 'build.xml'
	* Added the 'Wesnoth project' View specialized for viewing wesnoth projects
	* Added wizard for new wesnoth config file (.cfg)
	** Helpers**
		- pressing F2 on different wml elements, brings up the WMLDoc:
			- macros - will display its name, definition and arguments
			- tags - will display a description for the tag
	** Navigation - Used with F3 or CTRL+CLICK **
		- map location - opens the map in the editor
		- macro calls - goes to macro definition
	** Autocompletion **
		* We now have priorities, so more important stuff is shown first. Currently
		  the following order is in place: key values > key names > tags > macro calls
		- tag names
		- mandatory tag keys are automatically added for each auto-completed tag
		- key names
		- macro calls
		- key values: enums, scenarios

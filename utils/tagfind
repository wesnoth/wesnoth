=head1 NAME

tagfind - find and print attributes associated with WML tags in source files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    find /usr/share/wesnoth -name '*.cfg' -print | xargs tagfind

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script helps to keep track of actual usage of WML, as opposed to
its implemented syntax.  Given a list of input WML files, it lists the
attributes that are associated with each WML tag.  Each attribute is
listed once.  Tags without attributes are not listed.

Basic syntax checking is done.  Bad tag nesting is flagged and the
script will terminate at that point.

Using a simple stack to keep track of the current tag is Ayin's idea.

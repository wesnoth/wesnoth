   * new tag [filter_radius] to allow greater control over radius expansion
     when using the standard location filter
   * fix a bug where containers could only be stored at the top-level
   * fix a bug where both x and y had to be specified in location filters
   * better handling/reporting of invalid WML variable type usage
   * new key find_in= to allow searching a variable of previously
     stored locations when using the standard location filter
   * new key find_in= to allow searching a variable of previously
     stored units when using the standard unit filter
   * new extra_defines= key to define in campaigns some other preprocessor
     symbol *before* the files are repreprocessed
   * fog and shroud tiles are now defined by the TerrainWML (not [game_config])
   * new key store_location_as= to store generated chamber item locations
   * the border has been made themable
   * Instead of having an empty upkeep type as the default when reading a
     config file being used to normally give leaders a 0 upkeep, now leaders
     (canrecruit=1) are specifically exempted from upkeep and the upkeep
     type defaults to "full" when read from config files the same as for
     using the recruit function. This makes documenting how upkeep works
     simpler (it currently wasn't really correct) without having to make
     leaders loyal. It also will work better for campaigns where the leaders
     change (not that there are any now) so that the current leader is
     exempted and any exleaders pay for upkeep (unless the are specically
     marked as loyal).
   * make random_traits default to "yes". Leaders can't get random traits
     yet, because it breaks MP, but it does give campaign units traits
     by default. It also allows specifying some traits and letting the
     rest fill in randomly. Some traits are always forced on for units
     that can get them (undead and mechanical).
   * not_living tag removed from race, as this information is provided
     by the undead and mechanical traits.
   * the default for turn limit has changed to unlimited, if you have scenarios
     which rely on the old default of 50 please add a turns parameter to it
   * In help, remove the useless "None" terrain type from the terrains list of
     an unit
 * team color
   * allow color ranges to be defined on-the-fly (like color palettes)
   * now [side] colour=<string> is valid (previously only int)
 * miscellaneous and bug fixes
   * added a .desktop entry for the editor so that it is shown
     in the kde/gnome menu
   * rewrote the config merge routine (should improve parse time slightly)
   * various code cleanups
   * Isle of Anduin renamed to Isle of Alduin to avoid copyright problems.
   * the assertion 'str.size() <= 4' no longer happens, instead the terrain
      is read as 'void' and an ingame message is shown (bug #9609)
   * IMPORTANT! End-of-scenario no longer takes you immediately to the
     next scenario or the lobby. Instead, you linger in browse mode --
     menu commands for chat, saving games, etc. are available.
     Clicking end-of-turn ends the linger and takes you out.
   * fixed a bug-cheat allowing super-ranged attack in some special cases
     (thanks jgp93)
   * fixed incorrect displayed reachable zone when moving next to an enemy
     in special ZoC cases (skirmish or lvl0)
   * It seemed it's ambiguous whether the GPL license as supplied by
     Wesnoth means GPL 2 or GPL 2+, since Sirp's orginal intent was
     GPL 2+ the license has been changed accordingly.
     (See https://mail.gna.org/public/wesnoth-dev/2007-07/msg00014.html)
   * When advancing from Dark Sorcerer to Lich, you now get the undead
     trait. The way this is fixed can add random traits if the new unit
     type allows more traits then the unit currently has. This would
     cause a problem for multiplayer, but no advancement paths currently
     have this case. You do get to keep your current traits, even if you
     wouldn't get them in the new unit type.
   * the minimum savegame protection is ignored when either the savegame
     or the current game has 'test' as version
   * Add 2 debug commands: "fps" for showing framerate, and "benchmark"
     to force a continuous refresh of the screen (for testing the real fps)
   * fixed bug keeping highlighted the previous selected hex after a
     right-click cancel on map using fog/shroud
   * slightly optimize the showing of the attack dialog
   * some hotkeys (*,~,{,},^,|,@,#,<,&) are now visible in the hotkey settings

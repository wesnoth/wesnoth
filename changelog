Version 1.13.10+dev:
 * Campaigns:
   * The Cutscene_Minimal theme is now used in all dialog only scenarios that
     have linger=no in [end_level].
   * A Tale of Two Brothers:
     * Added a full set of hints on easy difficulty.
 * Contiuous Integration (CI) and Unit testing
   * Renamed the target and binary for the Boost unit tests from `test` to
     `boost_unit_tests`. This quells warnings from CMake about reserved target
     names, and reduces confusion about which `test` is intended: the wesnoth
     executable or the standard shell command.
 * Language and i18n:
   * Updated translations: Chinese (Simplified), Italian

     CPU usage in fullscreen windows such as MP lobby by about 85 %.
 * User Interface:
   * Removed broken Unit Box and Widescreen themes.
   * Fixed a bug that partially prevented movement feedback announce messages
     to be displayed (UI regression bug #2130, affecting 1.13.8 and 1.13.10).

   * Fixed individual Join/Observe buttons acting on the wrong game in the MP
     Lobby.
   * Greatly improved behavior of sliders.
   * Fixed crash when modifying an existing friend entry in Preferences.
   * Fixed players being unable to start campaigns in MP mode.
 * WML Engine:
   * File paths with backslashes are no longer allowed. This ensures that a UMC
     author can't accidentally use them and make an add-on that breaks on
     GNU/Linux and macOS.
   * File paths are now case sensitive even on Windows.
 * Miscellaneous and bug fixes:
   * Fixed ingame help showing units you haven't encountered (bug #2135)
   * Fixed the opacity IPF resetting to 0 if the value given was 100% or
     greater (bug #2185).

 * Add-ons client:
   * A list of illegal filenames is displayed if any are found by the server
     when uploading.
 * Add-ons server:
   * A list of illegal filenames is sent to the client if any are found during
     the upload validation process. Only clients supporting this new
     functionality can display the list.

     add-on passphrases was changed since 1.13.8, breaking existing hashes
     (bug #2068).

   * Fixed a bug where the client would return to titlescreen on receiving a
     redirect message from the server, which made connecting to the official
     server via the "connect to official server" button impossible.
 * Miscellaneous and Bug Fixes:
   * Updated our included Spirit Po version from 1.0.1 to 1.1.2.
   * Fix idle AI being replaced by default AI under certain circumstances on

   * Fix wesnoth.put_unit not correctly deciding whether to fire the unit placed
     event in some situations
   * wesnoth.debug() can now be called from map generators or plugins. It is
     also deprecated, however; you should use wml.tostring() instead.
 * Multiplayer:

     [about] tags under a single header. This is a toplevel tag, not a subtag

       attack, as opposed to attack_num which contains the WML index.
     * weapon (in second two return values) contains the actual weapon userdata

     * flag and flag_icon are never an empty string
     * New mutable keys: suppress_end_turn_confirmation, share_vision
     * New read-only keys: share_maps, share_view
       num_units, num_villages, total_upkeep, expenses, net_income
     * Existing keys made mutable: shroud, fog, flag, flag_icon
   * wesnoth.scroll_to_tile now accepts a third boolean argument - if true, the scroll
     is skipped when the tile is already visible onscreen.
   * The config accessors in the helper module now give a sensible error message if
     something other than a config is passed as the first argument.
   * wesnoth.deselect_hex no longer deselects units; it only unhighlights the hex.
   * wesnoth.select_unit with no argument (or nil argument) now deselects any unit.
   * Fix lua side:matches always iterating over all units on the map.
 * Multiplayer:
   * New maps: 2p Clearing Gushes, 2p Hellhole, 2p Ruined Passage,
     2p Ruphus Isle, 2p Swamp of Dread, 2p The Walls of Pyrennis,
     2p Tombs of Kesorak, 4p Bath of Glory, 4p Geothermal.
   * Updated maps: Fallenstar Lake.
 * Units:
   * Several changes to names of attacks:
     * Shock Trooper, Iron Mauler, Mage of Light: maces and morning stars
       changed to flails.
     * Arif, Ghazi, Khalid, Shuja: long sword changed to sword.
     * Mighwar, Monawish: long sword changed to longsword.
   * Updated unit descriptions: Orcish Grunt line, Merman Fighter line,
     Sergeant, Lieutenant, General, Peasant, Royal Warrior, Ancient Lich,
     Dwarvish Steelclad.
   * Changed (mainly reduced) recruit costs of many high-level units:
     * Dwarvish Lord, Direwolf Rider, Troll Warior, Banebow, Draug.
     * Elvish Avenger, Champion, Hero, High Lord, Marksman, Marshall,
       Ranger, Sharpshooter.
     * Mage of Light, Fugitive, Huntsman, Ranger.
     * Batal, Hadaf, Mighwar, Mufariq, Rasikh, Shuja, Tineen.
 * User Interface:
   * List boxes now keep the selected item visible when you change the sorting
     option.
   * The Addon Manager has a brand new interface.
   * Modification selection is now always available when selecting a SP campaign.
   * Scrolling the Editor palette no longer also scrolls the map.
   * Removed the old GUI1 MP screens.
   * Ensured dialogs with unit preview panes start with some extra space.
   * Fixed an issue where certain long labels would cause scrollbars to appear.
   * Greatly reduced the number of zoom levels available.
   * Experimental change: removed scrollbar up/down buttons.
   * Converted Hotkey Bind popup to GUI2.
   * Fixed TC color in Faction Select sometimes not matching the side's selection.
   * Ensured sides are always ordered by index in MP Staging.
 * Wesnoth Formula Engine:
   * New str_upper and str_lower functions for case transformations
 * WML Engine:
   * Update [store_side] to store everything in corresponding wesnoth.sides[*].__cfg
     and additional keys: num_units, num_villages, total_upkeep, expenses, net_income
   * Removed LOW_MEM option when building.
   * Add color= attribute to [floating_text]
   * Add ~CHAN() IPF that allows altering images according to formulas
     It takes up to 4 WFL formulas, one for each channel (red, green,
     blue, alpha); each works the same as the ~ADJUST_ALPHA() formula.
   * New ability_type key in standard unit filters matches if the unit has any
     ability of the specified type (tag name).
   * Terrain flags "_border" and "_board" are now automatically set for every
     tile, indicating whether it is on the map border or not.
   * SUF type_tree renamed to type_adv_tree for consistency with [hide_help]
   * [message]s no longer trigger a scroll if the unit is onscreen.
   * Removed the ~DARKEN() and ~BRIGHTEN() IPFs.
   * {SOUND_POISON} and {SOUND_SLOW} have been deprecated and replaced with empty
     macros.
   * [tunnel] now accepts delayed_variable_substitution=yes/no.
   * [on_redo] is now deprecated and does nothing if used
 * Miscellaneous and bug fixes:
   * Fixed severe lag/freeze on slow PCs (bug #25356)
   * Updated wmlscope to handle the square braces syntax in file paths

   * Do not load the Markov name generator if a CFG generator could be loaded.
   * Exit "quick replay" mode in MP games once the game is caught up.

Version 1.13.6:
 * AI:
   * Added new high_xp_attack candidate action to default AI. This CA performs
     attacks on enemy units so close to leveling that the default AI's combat CA
     would not attack them.
   * New Micro AI: Assassin Squad AI
   * Fix bug #23720, AI units with max_moves=0 do not attack.
   * Fix bug #22179: [disable] weapon special is ignored by AI. A second
     instance of the AI also ignoring this special under different circumstances
     has also been fixed.
   * Fix bug of Experimental AI recruiting sometimes failing under shroud
   * Fix some mainline campaigns custom AIs not working due to syntax changes
     after the AI refactoring for Wesnoth 1.13.5 (e.g. bug #25123)
   * Significantly improve move times for AI sides with many guardians
   * Micro AIs, other Lua AIs and ai_helper.lua utility functions:
     * Correctly and consistently deal with invisible units
     * New ai_helper functions get_attackable_enemies, get_visible_units,
       is_attackable_enemy, is_incomplete_move, is_incomplete_or_empty_move,
       is_visible_unit and robust_move_and_attack
     * Renamed function ai_helper.to_triple to LS_to_triples for consistency
       with other functions
     * Some internal changes to fix rarely occurring bugs and to improve
       robustness and speed
 * Campaigns:
   * Eastern Invasion:
     * Fixed broken village encounters.
     * Tweaked the balance of Scenario 2.
   * Heir to the Throne:
     * Reworked the map and added new AI behavior in 'The Princess of Wesnoth'.
   * Delfador's Memoirs:
     * S9: Resolved inability to end level even when Delfador has the Staff
       (bug #24951)
     * S17: Resolved Wesnoth units returning to recall list not being healed
       properly (bug #24952)
     * S19: Resolved undead veterans victory condition not working properly.
   * Under the Burning Suns:
     * Redesign of all desert elf units (currently optional, selectable through
       the difficulty menu).
 * Graphics:
   * Improved or new terrain graphics:
     * New wooden floor variation and transitions.
     * New aquatic encampment.
     * New aquatic castles.
     * Reworked stone walls so they take up less space and improved transitions.
     * Added Wooden and Rusty Gates.
   * Improved connections between castle and wall terrains, allowing castles and
     keeps to be placed adjacent to walls without glitches in most cases.
   * New sprite for Tentacle of the Deep.
   * Tweaked colors for all time schedules.
 * Language and i18n:
   * Updated translations: Finnish, Polish, Russian
 * Lua API:
   * Upgrade to Lua 5.3.3+
     Consult http://www.lua.org/ for a full change list and updated documenation.
     * bit32 functions removed
     * utf8 support added
   * Added new function wesnoth.fire_event_by_id to fire an event with a given ID.
   * Added new function wesnoth.remove_modifications, which removes applied
     modifications of the chosen type from a unit. The most efficient use is to
     remove all modifications with a specific duration value.
     Also callable as u:remove_modifications.
   * The built-in conditionals have_unit, have_location, and variable are now
     present in the wesnoth.wml_conditionals table. This means they can be
     directly called, extended with new features, or even overridden with custom
     implementations.
   * New recall_filter field in unit proxy returns the [filter_recall] config
   * New variations field in unit_type proxy returns a list of unit variations
     Each member is a full unit_type describing that variation.
     The table is iterable with pairs().
   * Lua side, unit_type, and unit attack proxies can now be compared with ==
     with identity semantics. (Previously, each time such a proxy was obtained,
     it would produce a new object that did not compare equal to any others.)
   * Lua unit_type lists (wesnoth.unit_types and unit_type.variations) are now
     countable with the Lua length operator.
   * Lua dialog functions now support the stacked widget and the unit preview pane
   * New wesnoth.show_menu function shows a dropdown menu at the mouse location
   * Lua attack proxy has new read_only field which is true for unit_type attacks
     If true, attempts to change the attack will result in an error.
   * The name field in Lua attack proxy is now writable
   * The attacks field in the Lua unit proxy is now writable
     Specifically, attacks may be replaced, appended (by assigning a new ID or
     the next valid index), or removed (by setting a field to nil).
   * wesnoth.show_message_dialog supports second_portrait and second_mirror keys
     in its first argument, which produces a dialog with two portraits.
   * The callable userdata returned by wesnoth.textdomain can now be called with
     an additional two parameters (a plural string and a count) in order to support
     gettext plurals.
   * New matches function in team and unit attack metatables, which test if the
     side or weapon matches a filter.
   * helper.lua metatables are now protected from external access; getmetatable()
     will return a descriptive string instead of the metatable.
   * ai.aspects.attacks no longer returns a full attacks analysis. Instead it
     returns a table with "own" and "enemy" keys containing the valid units
     for attackers and targets. The function ai.get_attacks() still returns the
     full attack analysis.
   * Aspect fetcher functions (eg ai.get_aggression()) are now deprecated in favour
     of the ai.aspects table.
   * The location_set iter and stable_iter functions can now be called with no argument.
     In this case, they return an iterator suitable for use in a for loop.
   * New wesnoth.wml_matches_filter function takes a WML table and a WML filter and tests
     if the table matches the filter. The filter syntax is as with [filter_wml].
 * Music and sound effects:
   * Added a preference to pause the music when the game loses focus.
   * Now the music fades out between scenarios.
 * Networking
   * Ported campaignd to use boost.asio instead of SDL_net.
   * Removed unit tests for old networking stack. This was the last part that
     depended on SDL_net
 * Performance:
   * When a heuristic determines that it's probably faster, the game predicts
     battle
     outcome by simulating a few thousand fights instead of calculating exact
     probabilities. This method is inexact, but in very complex battles
     (extremely high HP, drain, slow, berserk, etc.) it's significantly faster than the
     default damage calculation method.
 * Units:
   * Changed the sound for the melee attack of the
     Loyalist Bowman, Orcish Crossbowman and Orcish Slurbow.
 * User Interface:
   * Trait descriptions in the help are now generated. (This makes user-defined
     traits show up in the help as well.)
   * Fix game map sometimes showing and buttons sometimes not rendered properly
     in story screen (bug #24553)
   * Improved font rendering on Windows.
   * Redesigned gamestate inspector window.
   * Recall dialog no longer shows units that no leader on the map can recall
     (due to the [filter_recall] not matching)
   * Weapon specials only gained through AMLAs now get a help topic
   * The "Cores" button on the title screen is now hidden if no cores other
     than the default are installed
   * Redesigned game dropdown/context menu appearance
   * New categories bar in hotkey preferences allows you to filter hotkeys
   * Fix issue with the title screen not redrawing when the window size or
     fullscreen setting changes with a dialog open over it.
   * Restored descriptions for choices in combobox-based Advanced Preferences
     entries (lost in 1.13.3).
   * When using the --wconsole option, the game now prints a prompt in the event
     of a fatal error to avoid closing the console before the error can be seen.
   * Restored GUI2 textbox selection highlight lost in version 1.13.3.
   * Added a "Draw Number of Bitmaps" option to the map editor, for terrain
     graphics diagnostics.
   * Ported file chooser dialog to GUI2, and redesigned it to include a
     bookmarks bar with predefined and user-defined shortcuts.
   * Tweaked the border/groove color scheme on textboxes and sliders to better
     reflect their state and mimic window and button borders.
   * The following dialogs have been converted to GUI2: Unit Recall, Unit List,
     Game Stats, MP Create, MP Game Lobby, Faction Select, Unit Advance.
   * Improved UI responsiveness.
   * Tab completion in the Lua console is improved. It can now handle paths
     containing square brackets (though it won't complete them) and will not
     offer keys that are not valid identifiers.
 * WML Engine:
   * Added ignore_special_locations=yes|no, default no, to [terrain_mask] to
     ignore the special locations given in the mask, leaving all those on the
     underlying map unchanged.
   * [terrain_mask] starting locations and special locations are relative to
     the mask. Existing names replace any in the underlying map regardless of
     their location. Each name as a unique location; but a location may have
     any number of names. While a map/mask can give only one name per location;
     stacking masks allows multiple names. Names cannot be removed.
   * Added {HAS_NO_TURN_LIMIT} macro for objectives
   * New attributes for [message] with [option]
     * Added variable= to [message]: if specified, gives variable name to
       receive the [option] index (1..n) selected
       only used if any [option] appear
     * Added value= to [option]: if specified, gives value to store in variable
       instead of index number, only used if variable= appears in [message]
     * New second_unit, second_image, second_mirror attributes for showing two
       portraits on a single message.
   * New attributes for [role]:
     * search_recall_list=yes|no|only(default yes) controls where to look
     * reassign=yes|no(default yes) if no, check for a unit and do not assign to
       another
     * [auto_recall] sub-tag, if assigned to recall list, gives [recall]
       attributes (no SUF)
     * [else] sub-tag, WML to execute if no unit found for the role
   * New help_text= key for [trait] to set the description displayed in the
     help.
   * Added tag id= [fire_event], which allows raising events by id
   * [modify_unit] now understands [effect] tags, which it applies directly.
     This replaces the use of [object] with no_write=yes (which will be removed
     in the next release).
   * Add [object]take_only_once=yes|no (default yes) - if set to no, automatic
     tracking is disabled for this object (allowing it to be taken multiple
     times even if it has an id).
   * New [remove_object] tag which removes applied [object]s from matched units;
     it can filter on the entire [object] WML. The most efficient use is to
     remove all objects with a specific duration value.
   * Renamed [foreach] variable= to array=
   * Renamed [foreach] item_var= to variable=
   * Fixed several bugs in the name generation of the map generator
   * Fixed issues with using [endlevel] in victory/defeat events
   * The {MAGENTA_IS_THE_TEAM_COLOR} macro is no longer needed in [unit_type]
     It is now the default behaviour unless overridden with the flag_rgb key.
   * New key type_tree in unit filters - similar to type, but also matches any
     possible advancements of the specified unit types.
   * [options][combo] in [scenario], [modifications], etc has been renamed
     to [choice] (which is more accurate). The old name still works for now.
   * ~ADJUST_ALPHA() image path function now takes a WFL formula. It can access
     the following variables: x, y, width, height, red, green, blue, alpha.
     It no longer accepts a percentage (use ~O() for that).
   * Fixed [rule] in [terrain_mask] ignoring use_old=yes
   * Fixed filter returning invalid locations if invalid locations were given
     in a variable that was used with find_in=
   * Moves cave map generator to lua. scenario_generation=cave is now deprecated and
     will be removed soon. The Lua version has feature parity with the old one, but
     the syntax is a little different. It supports both map_generation and
     scenario_generation.
   * Tunnel functionality was expanded and the default behavior was altered in
     order to make moves through tunnels consistent with all other moves:
     * Vison through tunnels is now possible and enabled by default. It can be
       turned off by setting allow_vision=no in the [tunnel] tag.
     * Own and allied units on tunnel exits do not block the tunnel any more.
       The blocking behavior can be reenabled by setting pass_allied_units=no
       in the [tunnel] tag.
   * Added text_alignment= key to [story][part] to specify horizonal alignment of
     text.
   * [set_variable] now supports abs= (absolute value), power= (raise to
     power) and root= (extracts root, 'square' is the only value currently
     supported) keys
   * Individual [terrain_graphics] rotations can now be skipped entirely by
     using "skip" in the rotations= list.
   * WML macros can now include optional arguments with default values that the
     caller can override.
 * Miscellaneous and bug fixes:
   * A new way to make units invulnerable for debugging: select the unit and type
     ";unit invulnerable=yes". This method operates by decreasing the opponent's hit
     chance to zero: as a result, it doesn't slow down damage prediction unlike the
     "increase HP to ridiculous levels" method.
   * The ;choose_level command now works in the tutorial and in [test] scenarios
   * Fixed a stray ; character appearing pre-entered in the command console.
   * Fixed bug in wesnothd that was causing server crashes if game with
     multiple network and local players was ran.
   * Added a tab to run the wmlxgettext tool to GUI.pyw
   * Fixed problem with Spectre's hitpoint bar positioning.
   * Fixed crash when unit with planned actions is killed before those actions are
     completed (bug #20071)
   * Show correct number of attacks in case of swarm weapon special (bug #24978)
   * Fixed bug that icons of buttons under the minimap disappeared when the
     player opened and closed a menu.
   * Correct unit recall count in statistics when undoing a unit recall (bug #25060)
   * Add tip to recall units instead of recruiting them if costs exceed 20 gold (recruitment costs)
   * Resolve sides in map editor not having a proper side number and subsequently
     causing a crash upon editing (bug #25093)
   * Avoid rare cases of mini-map producing a divide-by-zero error (bug #25155)
   * [filter_vision]: fix bug of filter not matching own/allied hidden units
   * Prevent crash on quitting scenario with planned recruits present (bugs #24022/25193)

Version 1.13.5:
 * Campaigns:
   * An Orcish Incursion:
     * Linaera can recruit Mage, and cannot recruit Elves
   * Heir to the Throne:
     * Add journey tracks for 19c/20b path.
     * New sprites for Li'sar.
     * S10: Clarify objectives and change egg image on capture.
     * S19c: Removed the undead and the swamps.
   * Tutorial
     * Improve translatability for languages with gender-dependent pronouns
     * S1: Fix unit being deselected after the select message
     * S2: Highlight (outline) talked-about locations
   * Legend of Wesmere
     * S3: fix bug which silently disabled Urudin retreat AI
 * Graphics:
   * Updated generic portrait of Mermaid Initiate.
   * Added generic portrait for Giant Spider.
 * Language and i18n:
   * Updated translations: British English, Galician, German, Italian, Japanese,
     Polish, Portuguese, RACV, Russian, Scottish Gaelic, Spanish
 * Networking:
   * Reworked the multiplayer server to use asio functions for networking
     operations instead of SDL_net, thus it no longer depends on SDL_net and SDL.
   * The client now uses boost::asio for communication with wesnothd too.
 * Removed support for SDL 1.2. SDL 2 is now the only supported version.
 * Terrains:
   * Changed terrain code of Desert Mountains from Mdy to Mdd.
 * Editor:
   * Allow to set special locations in the editor which can then be read by wml.
 * User Interface:
   * Fix flickering caused by tooltips, closing windows and tabbing into the game (bug #24532)
   * Various design improvements to GUI2 widgets
   * New simpler GUI2 loading screen
   * New colored cursor graphics
   * Fixed Mage of Light halo appearing in the top-left corner of the screen
     while the mage is moving (bug #23712).
   * Fixed Observers icon appearing behind other top bar items in MP games on
     horizontal UI resolutions < 1024 (bug #24455).
   * Fixed ToD schedule progress indicator appearing behind other top bar items
     on vertical UI resolutions < 600.
   * Improved the dialog for choosing what to do when a player leaves in
     multiplayer.
   * The side overview now also shows allied human sides in sp even if
     they aren't discovered yet
   * Added an option to disable the loadingscreen animation since it caused
     bugs in some configurations.
   * Added a gui method to activate loggers (Preferences -> Advanced -> Logging)
     loggers activated in the gui print just like loggers activated in the
     command line (i.e. messages appear in the console)
   * The Lua console screen now has a clear button
   * Fix bug #24762: Editor actions are out of sync after resizing.
   * Increased the font size for text in buttons.
   * Changed unit help topics to use smaller images on smaller monitors.
 * WML engine:
   * Add color= attribute to [message].
   * Add [else], search_recall_list=, auto_recall= to [role]
   * Fix some issues with [foreach]
   * Fix some issues with backstab-like weapon specials
   * Support [effect]times=<integer>
   * Add highlight=yes|no to [scroll_to], [scroll_to_unit], [message]
     Defaults to no in the first two cases, yes in the third
     If yes, the target hex is outlined.
   * New ~SCALE_INTO(w,h) IPF which preserves aspect ratio, using bilinear
     interpolation scaling.
   * New ~SCALE_INTO_SHARP(w,h) IPF which preserves aspect ratio, using
     nearest neighbor scaling.
   * Support delayed_variable_substitution= in [on_undo], [on_redo]
     Note that this means $unit.x and $unit.y may not reflect the unit's
     true location, so using [unstore_unit] on $unit may have unexpected effects.
     This applies to $second_unit too. The $x1, $y1, $x2, $y2 variables work fine
     though, so in most cases they can be used instead. Anything else in $unit
     or $second_unit is also fine.
   * formula= in SUF can now reference $other_unit via the formula variable "other"
   * formula= now supported in location, side, and weapon filters
   * Weapon filters now support number, parry, accuracy, and movement_used
   * New [has_attack] in standard unit filters; supercedes has_weapon= and
     uses full weapon filter.
   * lua_function=var.member now works in SUF; however, 'var' still needs to
     be a global variable.
   * Added new keys name_generator, male_name_generator and female_name_generator
     for the [race] tag to declare a context-free grammar to describe how names
     are derived
   * Modification tags in [modify_unit] now support delayed_variable_substitution
     (This means [advancement], [object], and [trait] tags.)
   * All looping tags now give an error if they contain no [do] tag.
     (They may contain multiple [do] tags, however.)
   * Add [message]image_pos=left|right, which mostly supercedes ~RIGHT()
   * For [core] authors: New keys for game logo (game_logo, game_logo_background)
   * AiWML:
     * Filters within [micro_ai] can now use $this_unit, which was previously
       impossible due to the config being prematurely parsed.
     * Simplified aspect syntax which works for all aspects, present and future:
       * All aspects with simple values can be specified as key=value
       * Except attacks, all aspects with complex values have a simple tag form
         containing only the aspect value (e.g. [avoid])
       * All aspects, simple and complex, can be specified using a tag named by
         the aspect, whose contents is the same as a corresponding [facet]
       * The full [aspect] and [facet] syntax also still works
     * [ai] configs no longer recognize the version= key
     * ai_algorithm key now selects a preset AI; possible values include
       "ai_default_rca", "experimental_ai", and "idle_ai", but custom AIs
       defined by eras or modifications with an [ai] tag can also be used
     * [leader_goal] now automatically sets facet ID for auto_remove
       (Only if using simplified syntax; in full syntax, the ID must still be
       specified in two places.)
     * The AI config in the gamestate inspector is now split into multiple
       sections according to the type of component.
     * The following deprecated components have been removed:
       * recruitment stage (name=ai_default::recruitment)
       * old recruitment candidate action
         (name=ai_default_rca::aspect_recruitment_phase)
       * old simple move-to-targets candidate action
         (name=ai_default_rca::simple_move_and_targeting_phase)
       * number_of_possible_recruits_to_force_recruit aspect
       * recruitment_ignore_bad_combat aspect
       * recruitment_ignore_bad_movement aspect
       * The recruitment aspect has been removed from the engine; however,
         "recruitment" is now accepted as a synonym for
         "recruitment_instructions". Old code should work without changes.
       * [goal]name=protect_my_unit
     * The following experimental components have been removed:
       (Most of these were broken or non-functional)
       * Experimental recruitment candidate action
         This worked, but was worse than the default recruitment.
       * Global fallback candidate action
       * Akihara recruitment candidate action
       * Fallback stage (functional but useless)
       * Strategy Formulation with RCA stage
         This worked, but was slow and unmaintained. If a maintainer
         steps up, it may be restored later.
       * Several of the development AIs available in debug mode in the
         multiplayer setup menu
     * The "Strong AI" has been renamed to "Default AI (RCA) with Alternate
       Recruiting" and is now only available in debug mode.
     * Lua components (goals, aspects, stages, and candidate actions)
       now support an [args] subtag, which passes any sort of WML data
       to the Lua code - this works similarly to [args] in a [lua] tag,
       though not quite identically.
     * Aspect syntax with [aspect] tag has been fully generalized so that
       [aspect], [facet], and [default] are all exactly the same in terms of
       what contents they expect. (Except that [facet] additionally takes
       turns= and time_of_day=.) The most useful consequences of this:
       * You can nest a [facet] inside another [facet] if the outer one has
         name=composite_aspect
       * You can define a [facet] with the Lua engine
     * invalidate_on_tod_change= has been implemented for aspects. It applies
       when the bonus resulting from time of day modifiers (excluding any
       illumination abilities) changes at any location on the map. Thus, it
       occurs on average less often than invalidate_on_turn_start and may
       be best combined with an explicit invalidate_on_turn_start=no.
     * Minor shorthands have been introduced in the recruitment_instructions
       aspect:
       * [pattern] tag is like [recruit] with pattern=yes
       * [total] tag is like [recruit] with total=yes
       * If no [recruit] tag is present, a default is added with importance=0.
         This means recruitment will happen even with only [limit] tags.
     * Extensions to [modify_ai]:
       * [modify_ai]action=change works on aspects, using path=aspect[id].
         Useful if you need to change all the facets at once, but note that
         it also wipes the [default] facet.
       * The [default] facet can be referenced as facet[default_facet].
         This should rarely be needed, but is there in case it is.
         It also makes them easily identifiable in the inspector.
       * Automatically copy over the id= with action=change, if the
         new component did not specify one.
       * It can add, remove, and change jobs and limits in the
         recruitment_instructions aspect. The path to use for this is
         aspect[recruitment_instructions].facet[facet_id].recruit[recruit_id].
         (For a limit, replace "recruit" with "limit".)
         The [recruit] and [limit] tags now support id keys for this.
   * Added side_name= attribute in [side], it's now no longer possible to
     specify the current_player attribute in the [side] wml.
   * unit filters, specially in wesnoth.get_units now have a limit= attribute
     to limit the number or matched units.
   * Added new attribute "registered_users_only" to MultiplayerServerWML which indicates
     that only registered users should be allowed to join the game
   * wesnoth now does a stricter check for unit type ids.
   * In multiplayer,  victory events now fire at the end of the scenario if at least one
     human player has won, this fixes OOS in mp campaigns.
 * Lua API:
   * wesnoth.match_unit can now take a location (rather than a unit) as
     the optional third parameter. This will cause the filter to consider
     the unit to be on that location instead of its actual location.
     This even works for units on a recall list.
   * wesnoth.highlight_hex is no longer deprecated, but its effect is
     slightly different from the old one. It outlines a hex, nothing more.
   * wesnoth.select_hex is now deprecated in favour of the new
     wesnoth.select_unit (or u:select). The effect is almost the same
     (with the exception that it does not outline the hex if true is
     passed as the second argument), but this name change was done to
     emphasize that it acts on a unit, more than a location.
   * New wesnoth.set_time_of_day function which sets the current time
     of day, taken either as the time ID (eg "second_watch") or the index
     of the time in the overall schedule (eg, 1 would be dawn in the default
     schedule). Optional second argument takes a time area ID, to set
     local instead of global time.
   * New wesnoth.add_fog and wesnoth.remove_fog functions allow changing fog
     on the map. The [lift_fog] and [clear_fog] tags now use this.
   * New wesnoth.add_sound_source, wesnoth.remove_sound_source, and
     wesnoth.get_sound_source functions to allow manipulation of sound
     sources. The [sound_source] and [remove_sound_source] now use these.
   * New wesnoth.log function for printing log messages. The [wml_message]
     and [deprecated_message] tags now use this.
   * New wesnoth.name_generator function builds a name generator and returns
     it as a callable userdata. Both the original Markov chain generator
     and the new context free grammar generator are supported
   * New wesnoth.get_end_level_data() function which can be called in a
     victory, defeat, or scenario_end event to access (or change) how
     the scenario ends.
   * Fix wesnoth.erase_unit failing if the unit was on a recall list.
   * WML tables defined in Lua now accept string keys with array values
     (where "array" is a table whose keys are all integers). This joins
     the elements of the array with commas and produces a single string
     value. eg {x = {1,2,3}} is equivalent to {x = "1,2,3"}.
   * wesnoth.effects table can now be used to alter the behaviour of
     built-in effects - for example, to add a new feature to
     [effect]apply_to=attack. It also now supports effect descriptions,
     for use by the [trait] tag.
   * Additional fields in unit proxy:
     * usage, cost - self-explanatory
     * traits - list of the IDs of all traits
     * abilities - list of the IDs of all abilities
   * Additional fields in table returned by wesnoth.get_terrain_info:
     * icon, editor_image, light
   * Additional fields in unit type proxy:
     * race, id, alignment
     * attacks, which returns the same thing as unit.attacks
     * abilities, same as unit.abilities
   * Additional field in side proxy:
     * faction (read-only), faction_name (read-only)
   * LuaAI:
     * The table returned by check_*() now has a "result" field which
       gives a description of the action's result; similar to "status"
       but more descriptive.
     * Target tables now use a descriptive name for "type", instead of
       an integer. This applies to the elements of the table returned by
       ai.get_targets() and also to the elements of tables returned by
       Lua goals. (However, Lua goals that used integers will continue
       to work for now.)
     * There are some compatibility-breaking changes to Lua candidate
       actions - see the release notes or the wiki for full details.
     * Lua AI code can now access the AI routines through the global ai
       object. This object is only accessible to AI code; it does not exist
       in the general Lua global scope.
     * When executing Lua goals, aspects, or candidate action evaluations,
       the ai is in "read-only" mode - the read_only key is set to true,
       and functions that change the gamestate, such as ai.attack(), are
       missing from the table. (ai.check_*() functions are still present.)
     * The ai.aspects table provides access to every aspect known by the
       engine, including several that previously did not have corresponding
       ai.get_*() functions. You access them as ai.aspects.avoid, for example.
       The table is read-only and raises an error if you attempt to write to it.
     * The way to create Lua candidate actions has changed a little. Old code
       will require minor changes.
     * New wesnoth.micro_ais table contains the loaders for all Micro AIs.
       New loaders can easily be installed by add-ons. See any built-in
       micro AI (in ai/micro_ais/mai-defs/) for an example of how to do this.
     * The attacks aspect can now be defined as a Lua aspect. The code
       should return a table with keys "own" and "enemy", each of which may
       be either a unit filter table or a function which takes a unit as a
       parameter and returns true or false.
   * Added wesnoth.game_events.on_mouse_move/on_mouse_actions callbacks
     (fr #22635)
   * Added wesnoth.special_locations
   * [lua] tags now also support the [args] subtag outside events.
   * added lua_function= attribute in location filters
   * Added on_event.lua which is an eaiser to use wrapper for
     wesnoth.game_events.on_event
 * Multiplayer:
   * Hornshark Island: simplified multiplayer faction determination
   * Added "Registered users only" checkbox to multiplayer configuration dialog which
     when checked, only allows registered users to join the game
 * Wesnoth formula engine:
   * Formulas in unit filters can now access nearly all unit attributes
     The following attributes were renamed (old names still work, for now):
     leader -> canrecruit
     total_movement -> max_moves
     movement_left -> moves
     states -> status
   * Nearly all unit type, side, weapon, and terrain attributes available
     to Lua code are now also exposed to WFL. The exceptions are mainly
     translatable strings.
   * Unit and side WML variables are now accessible under "wml_vars".
     Since WML variables don't easily translate to formula variables, the
     special attributes __all_children, __children, and __attributes provide
     specialized views of the variables config as a list, string-list map,
     and string-value map, respectively.
   * The 'special' attribute of weapons was renamed to 'specials', and it now
     contains the special IDs rather than their translateable names.
   * New syntax features:
     * String interpolation syntax. Within a formula string (enclosed in
       'single quotes'), the syntax [some_formula] interpolates the result
       of the inner formula into the string. (The simplest use case is
       interpolating the values of variables.)
     * String can now escape special characters:
       ['] single quote, [(] open square bracket, [)] close square bracket
     * New 'in' operator which tests if a list contains an item or if a map
       contains a key.
     * New concatenation operator a..b which works on strings and lists
     * New range operator a~b which produces a list of consecutive integers
       This can also be used for "list slicing" - eg my_list[3~5] returns
       a new list containing elements 3 through 5 of my_list.
     * Lists can be used as an index for a list. This is "selection indexing"
       and returns a new list with only the elements specified by the indexing
       list.
     * Function definitions (using the def keyword) are now supported in all
       formula contexts, which means that they can be used outside FormulaAI.
       However, non-FormulaAI functions are currently local to the formula
       that declares them.
     * Maps containing string keys that are valid identifiers can now be
       indexed with the dot operator instead of the indexing operator.
     * Strings can now be indexed via 'string'.char[n]. Also supported are
       'string'.word[n] and 'string'.item[n] (the latter splits on commas)
   * Changes to core functions:
     * head() takes an optional argument - if present, a sublist is returned.
     * abs(), max(), min() now work on decimal numbers
     * reduce() function can specify an optional initial accumulator
       This will be returned for an empty list instead of null.
     * substring() function can now accept a negative size parameter
       This counts backwards from the specified offset
       A size of -1 is the same as 1.
     * if() can take two arguments; returns null if the condition is false
     * tomap() will now invert the effect of tolist()
     * debug_print() now shows in chat area if debug mode is on
   * New core functions:
     * Trig functions tan, acos, asin, atan have been added. (Sin and cos
       existed since at least 1.9 but were undocumented until very recently.)
     * Other common math functions - root(), sqrt(), cbrt(), log(), exp()
     * hypot(x,y) function calculates sqrt(x*x+y*y) with minimal error
     * pi() returning the circle ratio
     * tail() - opposite of head()
     * reverse() function for strings and lists
     * zip() function - converts [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] to [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]
     * take_while() function returns items from a list until the first one
       that fails a condition
     * find_string() locates a substring within a string
     * replace() replaces a sequence within a string
     * type() function checks the type of a formula result
     * distance_between() - this was promoted from FormulaAI to core
     * pair() function that produces a key-value pair suitable for
       passing to tomap() - this also means key-value pairs are now
       serializable (relevant in FormulaAI)
     * sgn(), trunc() and frac() functions for decimal numbers
   * Map generator engine:
     * makes now use of the new context free grammar name generator
     * ported name generation from english.cfg to [naming]
   * Bugfixes:
     * Dice operator is now synced (where possible)
     * Modulus (%) operator now works on decimal numbers
     * Exponentiation (^) operator is now right-associative
     * Fix several math operations returning a very large negative number when
       the operation was invalid (for example, (-2) ^ 0.5).
       Now they return null instead.
   * Formula debugger (accessed with the debug() function):
     * Now works again, but is skipped unless in debug mode
     * No longer explodes on formulas using less-than
     * Some better information and formatting in the execution trace
     * You can now step through "where" variable assignments
   * FormulaAI no longer starts recruiting if a formula evaluates to the
     string 'recruit'.
   * Deprecated:
     * The fai/faiend keywords are deprecated as part of a move to clearly
       define the difference between "Wesnoth Formula Language", the language,
       and "FormulaAI", the AI engine that uses the language. For now they
       still work, but any future code should use wfl/wflend instead.
       Use of the .fai file extension is still fine for FormulaAI code;
       for other formula code in a separate file, .wfl is recommended instead.
 * Miscellaneous and bug fixes:
   * Resolve translated logo images not being used (bug #24357)
   * Ported the "hexometer" tool from Bash to Python 3
   * Recognize hotkey release events
   * Allow changing keybindings for scrolling the map.

     https://github.com/AncientLich/wmlxgettext-unoff/
   * Debug commands that create units now do so for the currently controlled
     side instead of always side 1.
   * Fixed bug #24696 (Nightstalk ability not working)
   * Ported the following scripts to Python 3: TeamColorizer, about_cfg_to_wiki,
     campaign2wiki, terrain2wiki
   * Wesnoth now ignores unknown arguments that XCode may pass when testing.

   * Added unit elevation to NW-SE and SW-NE plank bridges
   * Hanging, stone chasm, and plank bridges are now displayed in-game simply
     as "Bridge", retaining their descriptive names in the editor as per
     convention.
   * Fixed spurious "could not open image 'terrain/.png'" error messages caused
     by terrains without a minimap image (symbol_image) such as those from the
     Special category in the editor (Impassable Overlay, etc.).
 * User interface:
   * It is now possible to switch from replay directly into normal play
     (bug #23833).
   * The game now shows a notification on remote clients if a sides takes very
     long to do a local choice (bug #23297).
   * It is now possible to replay a turn in mp games by loading autosaves.
   * The game now asks for confirmation when attempting to quit during the game.
   * Add "unit status=..." command to debug console to add/remove unit statuses
   * GUI2:
     * stacked_widget can optionally display a single layer at a time. This
       may be used to implement dialogs with multiple pages or tabs.
     * Widgets which are children of invisible or hidden parents can no longer
       be interacted with even if the children themselves are still internally
       visible.
     * Added support for tristate buttons/toggle panels or more generally
       n-state buttons/toggle panels

     of the campaign similar to [modification] [event]s
   * Added support for mod_x,mod_y= in [terrain_graphics].
   * Added support for has_flag= in terrain graphics [variant].
   * Added category= to [label] - allows grouping labels so that players can
     show/hide them
   * Add female_text= to [animate_unit] and [unstore_unit] for easier
     translating
   * Add female_message= to [message] for easier translating of lines spoken by
     generic units
   * AMLAs in [modifications] now use [advancement] tags instead of [advance]
     tags.
     This means you can add an AMLA to a placed unit by simply using its
     definition macro, for example {AMLA_DEFAULT}.
   * [get/set_global_variable]'s side= attribute now defaults to "global"
     (bug #23686)
   * [team] share_view=yes/no, share_maps=yes/no was replaced with
     share_vision=all/shroud/none

   * Fix macro definition line numbers being offset by 1 in WML preprocessor
     messages involving macros.

       units or AMLAs)
     * apply_to=attack - add set_ versions of all existing increase_ keys

       change the number of movement points the attack consumes
   * Ability to patch movetypes to account for custom terrains or damage types
   * Removed y offset by -1 from [message]'s scroll-to-unit logic.
   * Add [found_item] ConditionalWML to check if an [object]id= ActionWML has
     been taken
   * New auto-stored WML variable $other_unit usable in the following contexts:
     * [filter_adjacent] - $other_unit refers to the $this_unit of the enclosing
       filter (In weapon specials and unit abilities, the unit owning the
       ability.)
     * [filter_self/opponent/attacker/defender] (weapon specials)
       $other_unit refers to the other unit in the attack
       (eg in [filter_self], it's the opponent)
     * [affect_adjacent][filter] (unit abilities)
       $other_unit refers to the unit owning the ability
   * New rotate operators for directions: dir:cw and dir:ccw
     (This is useful mostly in conjunction with variable substitution.)
     These operators are applied after the existing '-' operator that takes the
     opposite direction.
   * Adjacency filters in abilities and weapon specials now support count= and
     is_enemy=
   * New implementations of backstab and leadership specials using $other_unit.
     In particular, leadership is now a single macro and it is not supported to
     give a unit a leadership ability of a different level (eg level 4
     leadership on level 2 unit). The backstab= key is deprecated.
   * Add new looping tags: [for], [foreach], [repeat]
   * Add new flow control tags: [break], [continue], [return]
   * Added a new [difficulty] tag for defining a campaign's difficulty level
   * Add new syntax for [option], similar to the new difficulty syntax
   * Add [test_condition] ActionWML that tells why a conditional failed (for
     debugging)
   * Add [remove_time_area] WML tag which takes a comma-separated list of time
     area ids.
   * [time_area] no longer warns about commas in ids when not using remove=yes.
   * Add [random_placement] ActionWML
   * In [set_variables] you can now mix [value] and [literal], and even [split]
   * Add [resource] tag which contains [event] and [lua] tags smimilar to
     [modification] but hidden from the user.

   * Add support for [endlevel] bonus=<number>
 * Editor:
   * Added Category field and color sliders to the Edit Label panel.
 * Miscellaneous and bug fixes:
   * Fix $this_unit auto-stored variable not working correctly in most SUFs
   * Made Documents\My Games\WesnothX.Y the default user config+data dir on
     Windows to replace the broken <current working dir>\userdata default that
     has never been acceptable practice. Portable installs are now required to
     explicitly use . or  .. (e.g. `--config-dir .\userdata`) to force the
     user config+data dir path to be relative to the current working dir (see
     also bug #23753).
   * Wesnoth now uses combined stdout+stderr log files on Windows, moved to
     <user data dir>\logs during initialization and first created in the user's
     temporary files directory defined by Windows. Log files are named like
     "wesnoth-<TIMESTAMP>-<PID>.log" and up to 8 log files are kept along with
     the latest session's log file. This avoids issues caused by SDL 1.2's
     built-in redirection code not being Unicode-aware (fixes bug #22897).
   * Removed legacy filesystem API implementation.
   * Fixed Generate Map dialog bug that caused last choice of map
     generator to not be actually selected (bug #23711).
   * Fixed unbound memory read in internal time formatting code with
     specially-crafted input.
   * Child wesnothd processes spawned by the Host Network Game option on
     Windows now display console output directly instead of using stdout.txt
     and stderr.txt.
   * Remember last selected modifications separately for single and multiplayer.
   * Fixed SDL2 compilation issues.
   * Fixed RECRUIT_UNIT_VARIATIONS core WML macro leaking an internal temporary
     variable ($recruited_unit_random_variation).
   * Fixed unit [resistance] and [jamming_costs] not being considered for sync
     check.
   * Fixed problems with slow/poison/petrify sounds (bug #23024) and made the
     sounds play automatically when the status is inflicted in combat, instead
     of being played by attack animations.
   * Fixed OOS on random maps, where clients placed sides in different castles.
   * Fixed some (not all) OOS caused by modifying a sides controller by wml.
   * Fixed wml menu items becoming unsynced in later scenarios.
   * The game now automatically detects whether to show the game connect screen
     between scenarios.
   * Fixed possibility of corrupting saved games in certain instances,
     eg if an add-on tries to set an invalid variable
   * Fixed bug 23060: unit stat tooltips do not show.
   * wmllint, wmlscope, wmlindent and wmllint-1.4 now run on Python 3
   * Text boxes tab completion now lists friends and whisperer nicks for easier
     answer (bug #9742)
   * Avoid crash when planning moves on planned recruits (bug #18637)
   * Fixed cases of wrong unit type used in planning moves (bug #20299)
   * Fixed hang when attempting to make a screenshot from a non-existent map via
     command-line (bug #20900)
   * Fixed Cancel Orders not working when loading MP game (bug #22133)
   * Fixed broken Oasis terrain help entry (bug #23023)
   * Fixed load game hot-key not working in the main menu (bug #23215)
   * Added user's leave notification for ingame players

   * Added "no mirror" and "no ally mirror" options to the MP configure screen.
   * Multiplayer content [era], [modifications] now carry version info of their
     associated add-on, and may have "addon_min_version" fields set which
     specify backwards compatibility with earlier versions.
   * Missing content for games hosted in the mp server may now be retrieved
     automatically by clicking on these games in the mp lobby.
   * Ported the password prompt displayed when joining a password-protected MP
     game to GUI2 (bug #23455).
 * Music:
   * Change main menu track to Journey's End.

   * Added a button to copy the currently displayed content from the :inspect
     dialog to clipboard.
   * WML array elements are now displayed with subscripts in the :inspect
     dialog.
   * Added a button to copy the in-game Chat Log dialog contents to clipboard.
   * Fixed the WML load error dialog not displaying an add-on name instead of

     _info.cfg file lacking an [info]title= value.
   * Fixed most of the minimap buttons and the End Turn button appearing
     without contents or in the wrong state during WML start events until they

   * Fixed mouse tracking issue with workaround by changing the default window
     resolution for OS X to 800 x 600 (bug #20332).
   * Removed the "Replay viewer" text label from the replay controller theme,
     because it caused problems for translators and was unnecessary
   * Fixed bug #22337: Bug in inspect long arrays
   * Added a new "Alerts" configuration screen under Preferences > Multiplayer,
     refactored all of the mp alerts / desktop notifications for customizability
   * Removed "desktop_notifications" and "lobby_sounds" advanced preferences,
     as they are subsumed by the Preferences > Multiplayer > Alerts screen now.
   * Added support for hyperlink rendering and clicking in gui2 labels.
   * Added lua interpreter console, accessible via a hotkey
   * Add lua console button to gamestate inspector
   * Add command history and history expansion to lua console, based on optional

   * Fixed game falling back to desktop if a user declines to load a previous
     version save from within a game
   * Fix bug #22984: Sliders (GUI1) focusing improperly in non-game contexts,
    and not responding to left-right key press
   * Wesnoth now ships with Bold and Oblique forms of its default font, Deja Vu
     Sans, and these are used in many menus and in the in-game help for styling
     text where previously we used SDL_TTF. Fixes bug #22376.
 * WML engine:
   * New image path functions:
      * ~XBRZ(): Takes one argument, the scaling factor (1-5). Uses the xBRZ
        scaling algorithm added in this release.
      * ~SCALE_SHARP(): Anologous to ~SCALE() but using the nearest neighbor
        scaling algorithm instead.
      * ~PLOT_ALPHA(): No arguments, plots the alpha channel in greyscale.
        Mainly useful for diagnostics of other function combinations, or
        debugging the engine itself.
      * ~WIPE_ALPHA(): Again mainly useful for diagnostics.
      * ~ADJUST_ALPHA(): Takes either a % or an 8-bit integer, and "multiplies"
        the alpha channel by this value.
      * ~SEPIA(): Gives the image a sepia tint.
      * ~NEG(): Gives the image a photographic negative effect.
   * Added customizable recall costs for unit types and individual units,
     using the new recall_cost attribute in [unit_type] and [unit] (bug #13074).
   * Added support for [elseif] tags inside [if]
   * Schema validator and preprocessor #warning messages now conform better to
     the new WML parser/preprocessor diagnostics format introduced in version
     1.11.10.
   * Added define= functionality to scenarios, eras, and modifications.
   * [unit] uses passed [advancement]s instead of unittypes advancements if
     [advancement] were given in [unit].
   * allow [lua] tags inside [modification] and [era] (which have the same
     effect as [lua] tags inside [scenario]).
   * enable side_for= in key [message] with [option]s.
   * added [effect] apply_to=fearless/healthy which is now used by
     healthy/fearless traits instead of hardcoding the id of those traits in c++.
   * added support for a shuffle key in the [music] music to allow selecting
     between random and non-random music play (bug #19653)
   * Fixed a bug that prevented [animate_unit] from displaying death or victory
     animations for those units that filter them based on weapon (eg. Wose)
   * New WML tags: [put_to_recall_list] and [sync_variable].
   * Fixed nested macros emitting incorrect bindings to the default 'wesnoth'
     textdomain at the end of a substitution instead of the parent textdomain,
     this breaking localization of subsequent strings (bug #22962).
   * Sounds for slow and poison are automatically played when slowing/poisoning
     a unit, and should no longer be played by the attack animations.
   * force_lock_settings defaults to yes in [scenario].
   * Moved all preprocessor diagnostics from the 'config' log domain to
     'preprocessor'.
   * Dropped support for [filter_side] in [gold] and [modify_ai], [theme] name=
     in place of id, and [object] duration=level.
   * Allowed direct modification of unit.ellipse variable even if ellipse= is set
     in [unit_type] or by an [effect]
   * Add accelerate=yes/no key in [delay]
   * Add support for status= key in SUFs
   * Add "disallow_shuffle" key in [side], which causes the "shuffle sides"
     feature always to skip this side, even if it is human playable.
   * Add "require_scenario" key in [scenario], [multiplayer], which causes a
     multiplayer game to require that all participants have the add-on installed.
 * Miscellaneous and bug fixes:
   * replace 'fight_on_without_leader'=yes/no with defeat_condition=no_leader/
     no_units/always/never which allows the wml developer to decide when a side
     is considered defeated
   * Fix Fisher-Yates implementation of Lua helper.shuffle (bug #21706)
   * Fixed issues with the ~BG() image path function not always working with
     cached images.
   * Idle controlled sides now serialize as human controlled.
   * Fixed bug #20876: A segfault in cut_surface.
   * Dropped support for AmigaOS, BeOS, and OS/2.
   * Increased the sound mixer channel allocation from 16 to 32, thereby
     raising the limit for simultaneous sound effects from 5 to 20, and
     simultaneous UI sounds from 1 to 2.
   * Fix bug #21758: "Ready not blocked while player pick faction."
   * Fix bug #18829: "ai sides show up as "controller=network" on remote
     clients". This issue is the source of some difficulties with mp campaigns
     which occur when the campaign is reloaded from a non-host side, or after a
     player rejoins from observer status. Hopefully, reloading campaigns is
     easier after this.
   * Fix bug #21797: "Mandatory WML child missing" when leaving a reloaded game.
   * Fix bug #21808: Cannot join a reloaded game as an observer.
   * Fixed halos glitching through locations that become shrouded after the
     halo is rendered for the first time.
   * OS X user data directory is now ~/Library/Application Support/Wesnoth_1.13.
     For compiling Wesnoth using Xcode, a new version of
     wesnoth_compile_mac_1.13.zip is also required.
   * Fix bug #21257: Lagging animations with skip AI animations and fog/shroud.
   * Improved unicode handling on windows for characters outside the Basic
     Multilingual Plane.
   * Fix bug #3856: The turn dialog used in hotseat MP play now applies
     a blindfold for the duration of the dialog.
   * Petrified units are no longer displayed in the "Damage versus" tooltip.
   * Fix bug #21759: "timer refreshed too often when time runs out"
   * Use one combo box instead of check boxes for replay options "skip replay"
     and "enter blindfold". This fixes the mp lobby in width <= 800 resolutions.
     Fixes bug #21888.
   * MP server now commits controller changes to the replay rather than updating
     as we go along. Among other things these means that players that join an
     scenario with ai sides which has already started won't have corrupted
     controller types which would prevent them from successfully saving and
     reloading in the future.
     We have also moved all "controller tweaks" associated to the start of MP
     games to server-side rather than having a mix of client and server code.
   * Fixup user-displayed strings associated to replay options, idle state
   * OS X: mark Wesnoth as not high-resolution capable. This greatly improves
     performance on retina devices.
   * Upgrade Xcode project to enable both i386 and x86_64 builds
   * Fixed problems with idle controller type in networked mp.
   * Fix bug 21459 by making dropped sides default to idle.
   * Fix bug 21882 by introducing "fight_on_without_leader" boolean attribute
     of [side] tags and refactoring check_victory to use this.
   * Changed: Don't use the random generator for units with no names.
   * Fix bug #21910: code for game is ready bell is corrected, simplified, and
     moved to mp_connect::process_network_data.
   * Deliver desktop notifications in tandem with "game is ready" bell and
     also the "game has begun" bell.
   * Fix bug in which blindfold could cause OOS.
   * Fix bug #21914: allow drake walking corpse variation to move on unwalkable
   * Fix unnecessary "Mandatory WML Child not found" error when replay file
     doesn't have a [carryover_sides_start] tag
   * Server now generates PR 121 compliant replay files.
   * Fix bug #21025: replay controller doesn't execute play_next_side properly
   * Fix bug #21916: ready blocked at inappropriate times
   * Fix bug #21931: controllers bugged in (basic campaign) when networked
   * Fix bug #21883: make sure movement animations don't cycle with fog on
   * Fix bug #21316: make subframes within standing animations cycle by default
   * Fix bug #21967: fix crash when unit modification to traits has empty id
   * Fix bug #19258, 21962: WML variables spuriously copied to replay_start
   * Fix implementation bug in random number generator: rand_pool_ is now an
     unsigned long rather than an unsigned int.
   * Fix bug #21491: fix drag+drop for unit movements
   * Fix bug #21448: make premoved units selection like in Wesnoth 1.10
   * Fix bug #21372: fix unit move continuation if enemy discovered
   * Added a Python/Tkinter based GUI to allow running wmllint, wmlscope and
     wmlindent in an easier way
   * Some commandline output which was helpful for noninteractive ai testing
     is redirected from std::cout to a logdomain "aitesting".
   * Added WML unit test capabilities, accessible from commandline using -u
     switch. These are useful for unit testing the WML / lua api.
   * Support for total conversions, so called "cores".
   * Fix bug #22030: correct index of weapon special disable in attack GUI
   * Fix bug #21964: assertion failure when using "controller" attribute with
     a number.
   * Add [do_command], which takes the body of a [command] tag from ReplayWML,
     (some possibilities not allowed), and executes the corresponding action.
     It is replay safe and triggers WML events as appropriate.
   * Reallow selection of another unit on same side without deselect first
   * Add "strict mode". Using --log-strict=[severity] causes wesnoth to throw
     a game_error exception when anything is written to a log as severe as
     that. For example --log-strict=warning causes both warnings and errors
     to generate runtime exceptions. This is intended for unit tests.
   * Fix bug #21867: team flag colors not refreshed after making use of
     [modify_side] color= unless a new flag set is also provided.
   * Fix a bug where in movement records, "skip_sighted" was sometimes
     spelled as "skip_sighed".
   * Fix bug #22020: make base units with variations help entry clickable
     from the 'Unit Description' menu entry or from side pane.
   * Fix bug #21977: ready blocked on scenario transition, when
     allow_new_game=yes
   * Add "MAKE_ENUM" macro to simplify parsing of WML options.
   * "MAKE_ENUM" macro signals WML parsing errors when the game is run
     in debug mode, and an illegal value for an attribute is encountered.
   * Fix bug #21397 Reloading may cause a side's turn is not initialized.
     This bug affected only networked mp, at least since version 1.8.
   * [modify_side] may now alter the value of [side] defeat_condition.
   * Fix bug #22116: unlock movement when attacking enemy+discovering in fog
   * In mp the other players now also proceed to the next scenario if one human
     player wins.
   * Fix bug #21397: "Saving and loading may cause a side's turn is not
     initialized".
   * Fix bug which caused no units to be displayed when reloading an end of
     scenario save, by stripping them from the save file. However, this does
     not fix bug #15545, which was the reason that this behavior was introduced.
   * Fix bug #22123 "Replays don't reset map when reset button is pressed,
     causing OOS"
   * Wesnoth reports an error if it evaluates [if] and finds no [then], [else],
     [elseif] children, as a chat message from lua.
   * Fix bug #22134: Campaign prefix not used in mp campaign saves
   * Made the error messages sent to stderr when the core data dir is
     incorrectly set more helpful.
   * Fix bug #20126: Recursive preprocessor includes cause infinite loop
   * Added 'faction_lock' and 'leader_lock' to SideWML to be used in MP Connect
     screen. Fixes bug #21978.
   * Fix bug #22231: partial moves now able to be continued in whiteboard
   * Added wmi_pager object to control how wml menu items are displayed in
     context menus, and allow to display more than seven.
   * Fix an inefficient implementation of unit::invisible, in an effort to
     address slow performance problems:
     http://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=12139&start=180#p569931
     (Also see gfgtdf's commits trying to optimize the minimap loop)
   * Made it so <exe location>/../ (non-Windows) or <current working dir>/../
     (Windows) are also considered possible data directories if they contain a
     data/_main.cfg file, intended to help with cmake builds.
   * Fix bug #21723: team-specific items displayed to wrong players / at wrong
     times
   * When parsing command line args, if we fail to parse, give an error message
     rather than crashing with no explanation.
   * Fix bug #22305: assertion failure in unit_display.cpp
   * Fix bug #22086: wrong or missing minimap previews displayed b/c of problems
     with saveindex
   * Fixed the SCATTER_UNITS macro so that it may no longer attempt to place
     units at the map borders.
   * Fixed bugs in [filter_vision] reported here:
     http://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=40702 [filter_vision] is now
     a check for *any* side matching the filter to have appropriate vision.
   * Add [has_ally], [has_enemy] to work around issues reported here:
     http://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=40702 In a side_filter,
     [has_ally] and [has_enemy] are corrected / simplified versions of
     [allied_with] / [enemy_of], this is an extension of the bugfixes for

     * Rebalancing of the campaign is now complete
   * Under the Burning Suns:
     * Updated animation WML of all campaign specific units
 * Editor:
  * Fixed: Drawing the offmap area for small resolutions.
 * GUI2:
   * Added: FAI-function handling in GUI2 widgets.
   * Added: A new tooltip window.
 * Language and i18n:
   * Updated translations: Scottish Gaelic
 * Lua API:
   * Config of current era is now available in a Lua table in MP games
   * Config of any era can be requested by id, also a list valid era ids
 * Multiplayer:
   * Fix for bug #21405, in a series of features:
     * The abort option presented to the host when a player disconnects
       from a networked game is now a "save and abort" option.
     * New Idle controller status: Sides may now be set in an "idle" state
       by the host when a player disconnects from a network game. This does
       not give any player control or vision. To proceed with the game, the
       host must reassign the side's controller using :control, :droid, or
       :give_control as usual. (give_control existed but was not documented)
       Related to this, there are new commands :controller which query the
       controller status, and :idle which toggles the idle status.
     * New "Blindfold Replays" option: Observers may check a box in the
       lobby so that if they join a game, they will be "blindfolded" and see
       only a black screen until they are given control of a side.
 * Units:
   * New baseframes for Jundi, Muharib, Batal, Qatif-al-nar, Qudafi, Rasikh.

   * New UI for displaying errors detected during the core and add-on WML
     loading process (parser and preprocessor errors), including the
     ability to copy the report to clipboard.
   * New UI for displaying the notification that a screenshot or map
     screenshot was successfully saved to disk, including options to open it
     in an external application, copy the path to clipboard, or browse the
     screenshots folder.
   * Force grayscale antialiasing for text rendered using Cairo/Pango (e.g. by
     GUI2) on Windows to work around ClearType-induced glitches (bug #21648).
   * Fixed bug #21584: Properly redraw the minimap when the minimap is
     resized.
   * Fixed: Enable blurring in the title screen.
   * Added descriptions to the options in Preferences -> Display -> Themes.
   * New sound played to signal the start of an MP game.

   * Implemented [true] and [false] ConditionalWML tags, which describe a
     condition that always yields true or false, respectively.
   * Fixed: Disallow change and remove sections without an id in the ThemeWML.
   * Added [theme] description attribute for including a description of the
     theme that will be displayed in Preferences.
   * [theme] name attribute is now expected to be translatable and used only
     for the theme selection UI. Existing [theme]s need to be converted to
     have a separate 'id' attribute.
   * [endlevel] now has two optional subtags [next_scenario_settings],
     [next_scenario_append], which can be used to reconfigure next scenario.
   * Optimizations made to the game events engine. Slower machines may notice
     an improvement during movement (when enter/exit_hex events are triggered).
     The optimization is more effective when relatively few events have variables
     in their names.
 * Miscellaneous and bug fixes:
   * Fixed: A compilation warning with DEBUG_WINDOW_LAYOUT_GRAPHS.
   * Added -Wold-style-cast to the CMake strict flags.
   * Made sure that cmake does not add -NDEBUG for release builds since this
     flag breaks building.
   * Updated screenshots used inside the ingame help and fixed description of
     orbs.
   * Fixed bug #21659: lua location_set:empty now works as described
   * Users now get a warning if they start a multiplayer scenario through the
     title screen load button, as this may cause eras and modifications not
     to work correctly in subsequent scenarios of an mp campaign.
   * wmllint can now update base terrain aliases in UMC after the changes in
     versions 1.11.8 and 1.11.9. This conversion is applied to the aliasof,
     mvt_alias, and def_alias attributes under the [terrain_type] tag.
   * Parser warnings when skipping over Unicode BOMs are now printed in stderr
     with the file location and substitution trail when available.

       not directly balance related changes have also been made:
     * S3: remove AI controller right-click menu option
     * S4 & S9: make AI attack enemies 1 XP from leveling so that it is not
       possible to block key locations with such units
     * S10 & S12: don't give huge unannounced gold bonus to AIs
 * Editor:
   * Added Impassable Overlay and Unwalkable Overlay terrains to the obstacle
     group.
   * Added Snowy Human City village terrain to the frozen group.

   * Don't force the .gz suffix on every entry of the save_index (bug #20849).
   * Fixed a bug in [filter_vision] in SUFs that caused a hidden unit under

     achieved by including a [feedback] block with a topic_id=<number> key in
     it.
   * Redesigned Add-ons Description dialog, including support for displaying
     add-on feedback page URLs.
 * Add-ons server:
   * Fixed mishandling of inaccessible add-on packs resulting in multiple data

     and the description panel.
   * Made filtering controls on the MP create screen functional.

   * Allow advanced preference booleans and mp modifications to be toggled
     via double click
   * Fixed slight scrolling glitches with credits sections with multi-line
     headers (e.g. those generated for campaigns with multi-line titles).
 * WML engine:
   * WML variable turn_number is set correctly (to 1) in prestart and start
     events.  Previously, it retained its last value from the previous scenario
     until after the start event.
   * [scroll_to] and [scroll_to_unit] now take an optional side filter.
   * [trait] now accepts a "generate_description=" attribute, allowing the
     auto-generated effect descriptions to be turned off.
   * [modify_side] can now change a side's flags and status bar icon using the
     "flag" and "flag_icon" attributes also accepted in [side] definitions

   * Fixed bug with scrollbar overlaying mp description text (bug #21364)
   * Fixed bug with help units not making links (bug #21339)

     --userdata-dir, with --userconfig-dir defaulting to --userdata-dir's
     value on some platforms.
   * The color_adjust_blue_ attribute in [display] tags of saved games has
     been renamed to color_adjust_blue. Since it is only non-zero following a
     [color_adjust] action in a WML event, only mid-scenario saved games
     created with previous versions may present minor color issues after this
     change.
   * Fixed sound sources removed while the sound effects volume is zero
     (either in Preferences -> Sound or through the [volume] WML action)
     persisting and escaping the sound source management code (bug #21426).
   * The negative sign is no longer dropped when formula AI prints numbers
     between 0 and -1.

Version 1.11.7:
 * Add-ons client:
   * Add-ons downloaded with clients from this version onwards are shown
     in the Remove Add-ons with their original titles from the add-ons

     underscores from file names.
   * Fixed color key disparities between the Add-ons Manager dialog and the
     add-on Description dialog.
   * It is now possible to choose the neutral/fallback add-on sorting in
     the Add-ons Manager dialog used when no columns have been sorted by
     the user.
   * Report errors caused by faulty local .pbl files properly instead of
     presenting them as network errors.
   * Fixed regression from 1.11.0 resulting in memory leaks and/or
     crash-to-desktop situations when failing to connect to an add-ons
     server.
 * Add-ons server:
   * Implemented read-only mode option (read_only boolean attribute in
     server config WML, defaults to "no").
 * AI:
   * Recruitment CA:
     * New Recruitment CA located in src/ai/recruitment is now default CA
     * Created new AI cfg "Strong AI (RCA)" with stronger recruitment
     * Created new AI cfg "Old Recruitment CA" in ai/dev/ to use the old CA
   * External CAs are now fully usable
     * The persistent data variable works and is accessible across CAs
     * Parameters can be passed to eval/exec functions
   * Micro AIs:

       definitions are needed any more and that MAIs can be combined at will
     * Got rid of animal_type=, guardian_type=and recruiting_type= keys.  The
       individual Animal, Guardian and Recruiting MAIs are now separate AIs
       that are selected with the ai_type=key
     * Patrol, Guardian and Hunter MAIs are now side-wide CAs (not BCAs) and
       support either the id= key or [filter] tag for unit selection

       weapons and when path to next waypoint is entirely blocked
   * Experimental AI:
     * Added new CAs Retreat, Move to Enemy and Village Hunting
     * Algorithm improvements for several CAs
   * Fixed time_of_day aspect so it matches time-of-day ids, not names
     (e.g. "Morning" vs "morning"), so most use cases of ToD-dependent AI
     configuration work again (suspected version 1.7.4 regression).
   * Move_Leader_To_Keep CA will now move all leaders back to a keep
     (multiple leader support for recruitment)
   * Refactored the AI-Test-Suite completely (/utils/ai_test/)
   * Changed AI descriptions in ai/dev/ displayed in MP computer player menu
   * New macro AI_CONTROLLER_ALLOW_UNIT_CONTROL

       with its status as an expert level campaign.  Scenarios 1 - 3 done so
       far.  In addition, the following, not directly balance related changes
       have also been made:

     allowing the display of a functional MP "Connect/Wait" screen before the
     next scenario.
   * Reload game config for non-host players in order to match the host's
     config, if possible. Reloads will only happen for MP campaigns using
     CampaignWML syntax.
   * Imagepath function "~ROTATE": Support for rotating by any degree.

   * Added "controller_lock" in SideWML. The lock provides a way to be sure
     that sides will be played with a controller which was assigned in WML.
     I.e. if "controller" was set to "ai", it won't be possible to select any
     other controller for a side. However, if "controller" was set to "human",
     it will still be possible to assign any player, local, network or
     reserved (if applicable) controller.
   * All multiplayer locks in SideWML (e.g. "team_lock"), now uses
     "force_lock_settings" as their default value.

     When specifying --config-dir on the command line %APPDATA% is used even
     without that define.

     * Made units with the healthy trait take half the damage from poison.
     * Decreased the ranged attack of the Bowman from 7-3 to 6-3.
     * Added the marksman special to the ranged attack of the Orcish Assassin
       line.

     have been started to replace the old code.
 * WML engine:
   * fix bug #11988: Events with multiple types are multiplied
   * added a new image-path function: CROP(x,y,w,h) - it extracts a slice
     of a graphic with the requested dimensions. (feature #12067)
   * allow variable substitution in event names
   * allow spaces or underscores to be used interchangeably in event names
   * In event attack filters ([filter_attack] and [filter_second_attack]),
     weapon= attribute has been deprecated in favour of AnimationWML-like
     attack filtering, which allows to filter damage type, range and weapon
     specials. Backwards compatibility with weapon= will be removed in 1.5.5.
     * As a consequence, [fire_event] has had [primary_unit] weapon= and
       [secondary_unit] weapon= deprecated too; use [primary_attack] and
       [secondary_attack] blocks instead.
   * In events triggered by unit fighting ('attack' et al), the weapon info
     is automatically stored in the 'weapon' and 'second_weapon' WML
     variables; this works just like 'unit' and 'second_unit'.
   * fix various minor bugs with attack filtering
   * Fixed linewrapping with not to wrap markups (bug #11946 and bug #11945)
   * fix bug where max_experience of stored units was not the true max when
     playing with under 100% exp. settings
   * Added support for labels and items that are hiden by fog (patch #1101)
   * Made it possible to use another color palette as second parameter in
     RC(A=B) image path function by using '=' instead of '>' as parameter
     separator; this allows simple color replacement that RC(A>B) did not
     allow.
   * prevent some negative/nonsense values in direct WML unit modifications
   * Renamed the advanceto key in [unit_type] to advances_to in order to be
     consistent with its own and [unit]'s internals.
   * implemented FR #11817: Allow [item]s to be visible only to specified teams
     (patch #1100 by Broodkiller)
 * Networking
   * removed null termination character from end of packet send by wesnoth
 * Miscellaneous and bug fixes:
   * Applied changes suggested by bug #11676 to wesnoth-optipng.
   * Changed side_drop handling not to automaticaly assign AI for side if
     leader is dead (bug #12186)
   * Changed the behavior of [modify_turns] value= to default to -1
     (no turn limit) instead of 50 if an invalid string is passed instead
     of a number.
   * Fixed [modify_turns] causing weird behavior when used in prestart
     or start events to change current turn.
   * Made config cache code available to eveverywhere in wesnoth
   * Fixed [modify_turns] giving the unwanted side-effect of changing
     turn limit when only current= modifier was used.
   * Fixed OOS bug when giving control and having move in undo stack.
   * Fixed [modify_turns] not updating $turn_number when current= was
     used.
   * Fixed crash when ai moves units next to level 0 hiden unit (bug #12252)
   * Fixed loading ai parameters. MP side defination now overwrites
     era values (bug #12171)
   * Fixed MP saves to transfer correct completion state to remote clients
     when loadin game (bug #10385)
   * Fixed can move enemy units (causing OOS) (bug #11205)
   * Fixed a few inconsistencies related to scenarios which are not at
     turn 1 at the beginning (namely start autosave detection and initial
     triggering of a matching "turn *" event).
   * Removed the compiler work arounds for MSVC6.
   * Added some more compiler workarounds for MSVC9.
   * Removed the --small-gui build option, starting Wesnoth with the
     --smallgui parameter achieves the same
   * new --nomusic commandline option to disable music for the session

Version 1.5.3:
 * Campaigns
   * Descent into Darkness
     * Changed how the beginning of the scenario 'Descent into Darkness' works.

       end when it was supposed to.
   * Son of the Black Eye
     * Fixed the shamans not getting removed from the recall list when they
       should.
     * New portraits for Inarix, Jetto and the old orcish shaman.
     * Reworked the scenarios 'Civil War' and 'Coward'.
 * Editor2
   * Future replacement for wesnoth_editor, launched from title menu or via
     wesnoth -e. Most old editor's features are duplicated, with some
     improvements.
   * Built by default in scons, cmake and autotools, if building manually
     see RELEASE_NOTES.
   * See http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Editor2 for details and known issues.
 * Language and i18n:
   * updated fonts: DejaVuSans 2.26
   * updated translations: Chinese (Traditional), Danish, Finnish, Galician,
     German, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish

     the Horatii, 3p Morituri, Blue Water Province, 4p Hamlets, Lagoon,
     4p Morituri, The Wilderlands, Waterloo Sunset
 * Music and sound effects:
   * Engine automatically plays special music on defeat or victory; default
     lists from which an option is randomly chosen at runtime are provided as
     the default_victory_music and default_defeat_music attributes in
     [game_config] node; this may be overriden per-scenario using the
     victory_music and/or defeat_music attributes on its code - it can also
     be overriden in a [endlevel] block by providing a music= attribute with
     the desired list (feature request #11203).
 * Python AI:
   * Added ai_init.py and ai_launcher.py to make it easier to customize
     AI environment and startup. Both are used by the new embedded python
     implementation.
   * reversed builtin is now allowed. This allows for random.shuffle to be
     called.
 * Terrains:
   * Added a new attribute, hidden=<boolean> (default: no), to [terrain],
     which prevents the map editor from offering the user a particular
     tile type for drawing.
   * Made user-made content graphic rules be parsed before core ones, so
     custom tiles look the same in-game as they do in the editor.
   * Set hidden=yes on main terrain archetypes (Gt, Qt, At, Xt).
 * User interface:
   * Added an experimental add-ons update interface.
   * Added initial drag&drop support for button widgets
   * Fixed a broken translation which gave all females the prefix female^ on

   * Make the load and recruit hotkey use the ctrl instead of cmd key on non
     Mac systems

     event were totally ignored
   * Added some convenience macros for units: {TRANSFORM_UNIT}, etc.
   * Extended [modify_turns] to allow scenario designers to change the
     current-turn number dynamically with current=<number>.
   * It is now possible to use [time_area] to add or remove new local ToD
     areas and their schedules during scenario events. Removal requires to
     associate an id. to [time_area]s, or it won't work. Uses Standard
     Location Filter to match locations.
 * Miscellaneous and bug fixes:
   * Add some gcc-4.3.0 compilation fixes (patch #1083)
   * Added a MSVC 9 project file and some fixes for that compiler (patch #1093)
   * Add-on uploads by default will skip all dot-files (.*), which are hidden
     files or directories in UNIX filesystems.
   * Downloaded add-ons' meta information is stored in <add-on dir>/_info.cfg
     rather than <add-on dir>/info.cfg now; both the in-game client and the
     wesnoth_addon_manager Python script have been updated for this.

     in die/last_breath events.
   * Fixed FULL_HEAL WML macro not working properly.

   * Fixed segmentation fault when wml modified and killed attacker and
     defender in a battle
   * Fixed Wesnoth crashing after an attacker/defender_hits/misses event if
     the WML kills one unit and replaces/unstores the other

Version 1.5.2:
 * campaigns:
   * Son of the Black Eye
     * new set of portrait art
     * in 'Black Flag', there's now several galleons transporting enemies to the

       the bridge
     * many assorted small tweaks to most scenarios
     * when leading the Great Horde, all units now require 1 less upkeep
   * Tutorial
     * Fixed players side name to same as leaders name (bug: #10114)
 * formula AI:
   * added variant_iterator to iterate over variant elements
   * modified choose, filter, find and map functions to use variant_iterator,
     so they work correctly with a variant_map type
   * new formula AI functions: contains_string, find_shroud, movement_cost,
     tolist, tomap, is_unowned_village, max_possible_damage_with_retaliation
   * added possibility to fallback to human player
   * new ai object members: side, my_recruits, recruits_of_side, time_of_day,
     units_of_side, villages_of_side
   * moved most of formula AI releated code from ai.cpp to formula_ai.cpp
   * new unit_type_callable and attack_type_callable classes
   * new unit_callable members: undead, attacks, abilities, traits
   * various fixes and improvements to formula functions
   * added new formula test scenario
 * language and i18n:
   * new translation: Latvian
   * updated translations: Arabic, Catalan, Chinese (Traditional), Czech,
     Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Lithuanian, Russian, Serbian,
     Slovak
   * languages in the language selection are now sorted on name instead of
     code.
   * unit alignment can be displayed in its gender-specific form in languages
     which require/support it (bug #11956)
 * multiplayer:
   * Added support for multiple sides per client in MP start.
   * Added support for reserving slots when reloading game.
   * Fixed timer end warning not to play in opponents turn. (bug: #11517)
   * Teams are now translated locally for all clients. (bug: #3676)
   * Fix an old pathfinding bug causing an inconsistency between the path used
     and the one showed to others players. It was only a visual error, but
     sometimes caused to see a enemy pass through your invisible units (or in
     their ZoC). Now all players see the same real path. Also valid for replay.
   * When joining a game, display your assigned starting position and the new
     team coloring also shows your assigned color.
 * units:
   * balancing changes:
     * increased the ranged attack of the Bowman from 6-3 to 7-3
     * decreased the melee attack of the Bowman from 6-2 to 4-2
     * decreased the cost of the Bowman from 15 to 14
     * increased the cold resistance of the Fencer line from 0% to 10%
     * decreased the 'orcishfoot' movement cost over frozen from 3 to 2
 * user interface:
   * Rewrote the textbox history saving of the new widget library. This rewrite
     is incompatible with the old version, but since the library is still in

   * Added gui to choose where server binary is
   * Added type-a-head search to file chooser dialog
   * Add a column for traits in the recall dialog.
   * Add a filter textbox in the recall dialog.

   * Tooltip texts now support blank lines and special markup characters
   * Add-on publish/delete options have now special icons and colors.
   * Display the name of the add-on in the "Add-on installed" dialog
   * The unknown unit icon used in status table is now team colored
   * In multiplayer lobby, all unit's images are now team colored.
   * In help, with debug mode, broken hyperlinks are now visible in red and
     when clicked open a error message showing the bad topic reference.
   * new debug command ":choose_level" or ":cl" to directly go to a scenario.
   * new debug command feature, ":next_level Some_Id" to directly go to
     scenario having id=Some_Id.
   * 'Create Unit' dialog pre-select the last created unit type
   * Fix incorrect downloaded add-on when using filter
   * Fix missing last publish/delete add-on option
   * Fix few broken hyperlinks in help (and some were working in english only)
   * Fix a regression about not working 'unit description' with hide_help=yes
 * Python AI:
   * get_variable now allows a default value to be passed to the call. If the
     key is not found, the default value is returned. This is fully backward
     compatible.
   * set_variable exception handling has been fixed to return an exception in
     the current call frame.
   * Many wesnoth module functions now release the python GIL when it is both
     safe to do so and the function call takes long enough where it also
     makes sense. More changes coming.
   * A new global boolean variable, 'restricted' is now set before the user AI
     script is invoked. This variable indicates if it is running inside of
     a restricted python environment or not.
   * A new class of unrestricted scripts are now listed. Previously only
     scripts which have #!WPY at the top are allowed. If only allow safe python
     scripts is disabled, scripts which start with #!UNSAFE_WPY are also shown
     to users. This allows AI authors to specifically target either a
     restricted or unrestricted environment.
   * New "system" class attributes are exposed in the restricted environment.
     These include; '__call__', '__copy__', '__deepcopy__', '__name__',
     '__repr__' and '__str__', in addition to the old __init__ method.
   * ValueError can now be caught.
   * Added a new AI, bruteforce_unsafe.py, which uses both function caching
     (memoize pattern) and psyco to speed execution. It uses the new UNSAFE_WPY
     tag and is not selectable unless "Only Run Safe Python AIs" is disabled.
     This version of bruteforce runs 1x-14x FASTER than the stock python AI;
     *heavily* dependent on the map and number of units involved.
   * Per the python API documentation, many functions now return boolean values
     rather than ints. Minor modernization effort to use new C-API macros
     provided via python 2.4+. This change is fully backward compatible for
     scripts which properly treat the return value as a boolean.
   * Initial wail directory checkin. It's only a teaser at this point. ;)
   * bruteforce_wail.py has been added - showing how easy it is to move a
     well written bot from the wesnoth module to the wail module.
 * WML engine:
   * When examining stored units, now the attacks, max_hitpoints, max_moves,
     and max_experience are the "real" values and can also be modified.
   * new attribute count= for [have_unit] and [have_location] conditionals
   * new mode "insert" for [set_variables]
   * max_attacks in [unit] now also works for values bigger than 1
   * the "zoc" key works for [unit_type] too, and for [unit] accepts other
     boolean values than 1 and 0 (bug #11889).
   * new effect apply_to=type to transform the unit to a different type
   * remove redundant unit.value (use unit.cost instead)
   * preserve unit.role in next scenario (bugs #3697, #4124, and #11329)
   * fix various problems with [set_variables] (bugs #11980 and #11981)
   * Add a new key "image" in [faction], used as icon in faction selection.
     The old hack consisting to add the image's url in the faction's name is
     still supported but doesn't have the new team coloring.
 * miscellaneous and bug fixes:
   * Fixed droiding not to make wesnoth think player is observer (bug: #9675)
   * Fixed statitics not add turn data from previus scenarios (bug: #11719)
   * Fixed manager to initialize before gamestate in playcontroller (bug: 11935)
   * Removed persistance from team configuration (bug: #10916)
   * Fixed text parser again strip cr from configs. Added CR and 254 to be
     escaped in campaign upload. All UMC has to be reuploaded to server
   * Made automaticaly generated macro reference easier to naviagate and link to
     (patch: #1076)
   * Allow [unit_type] num_traits=0 to override race's num_traits.
   * Small optimization of scrolling and things out of their hexes.
   * Added a command-line parameters "--smallgui" to allow lower resolutions.
   * Missing images are now replaced by a "men-at-work" sign (in debug-mode)

     and variation too.
   * maps now have a user definable border
   * Changed the mute hotkey from ctrl-m to ctrl-alt-m.
   * On victory, all old saves for the scenario except the start one

     name has changed from delete_autosaves to delete_saves.

     for all types of anims, you can have multiple such anims using different
     frame names
   * a new type of animation is triggered when a unit is selected. (WML
     support to come shortly)

     errors out.
   * If --enable-display-revision isn't enabled SVNREV is no longer
     defined in the build process.

     switch is also faster (cached)
   * the unit list now colors the stats of units.
 * WML engine:
   * added effect types new_ability and remove_ability using [abilities] subkey
   * now [base_unit]id= inside [unit] can extend upon existing unit types
   * new tag [filter_radius] to allow greater control over radius expansion

   * better handling/reporting of invalid WML variable type usage

   * the border has been made themable
   * Instead of having an empty upkeep type as the default when reading a
     config file being used to normally give leaders a 0 upkeep, now leaders
     (canrecruit=1) are specifically exempted from upkeep and the upkeep
     type defaults to "full" when read from config files the same as for
     using the recruit function. This makes documenting how upkeep works
     simpler (it currently wasn't really correct) without having to make
     leaders loyal. It also will work better for campaigns where the leaders
     change (not that there are any now) so that the current leader is
     exempted and any exleaders pay for upkeep (unless the are specically
     marked as loyal).
   * make random_traits default to "yes". Leaders can't get random traits
     yet, because it breaks MP, but it does give campaign units traits
     by default. It also allows specifying some traits and letting the
     rest fill in randomly. Some traits are always forced on for units
     that can get them (undead and mechanical).
   * not_living tag removed from race, as this information is provided
     by the undead and mechanical traits.
   * the default for turn limit has changed to unlimited, if you have scenarios
     which rely on the old default of 50 please add a turns parameter to it
   * In help, remove the useless "None" terrain type from the terrains list of
     an unit
 * team color
   * allow color ranges to be defined on-the-fly (like color palettes)
   * now [side] colour=<string> is valid (previously only int)
 * miscellaneous and bug fixes
   * added a .desktop entry for the editor so that it is shown
     in the kde/gnome menu
   * rewrote the config merge routine (should improve parse time slightly)
   * various code cleanups
   * Isle of Anduin renamed to Isle of Alduin to avoid copyright problems.
   * the assertion 'str.size() <= 4' no longer happens, instead the terrain
      is read as 'void' and an ingame message is shown (bug #9609)
   * IMPORTANT! End-of-scenario no longer takes you immediately to the
     next scenario or the lobby. Instead, you linger in browse mode --
     menu commands for chat, saving games, etc. are available.
     Clicking end-of-turn ends the linger and takes you out.
   * fixed a bug-cheat allowing super-ranged attack in some special cases
     (thanks jgp93)
   * fixed incorrect displayed reachable zone when moving next to an enemy
     in special ZoC cases (skirmish or lvl0)
   * It seemed it's ambiguous whether the GPL license as supplied by
     Wesnoth means GPL 2 or GPL 2+, since Sirp's orginal intent was
     GPL 2+ the license has been changed accordingly.
     (See https://mail.gna.org/public/wesnoth-dev/2007-07/msg00014.html)
   * When advancing from Dark Sorcerer to Lich, you now get the undead
     trait. The way this is fixed can add random traits if the new unit
     type allows more traits then the unit currently has. This would
     cause a problem for multiplayer, but no advancement paths currently
     have this case. You do get to keep your current traits, even if you
     wouldn't get them in the new unit type.
   * the minimum savegame protection is ignored when either the savegame
     or the current game has 'test' as version
   * Add 2 debug commands: "fps" for showing framerate, and "benchmark"
     to force a continuous refresh of the screen (for testing the real fps)
   * fixed bug keeping highlighted the previous selected hex after a
     right-click cancel on map using fog/shroud
   * slightly optimize the showing of the attack dialog
   * some hotkeys (*,~,{,},^,|,@,#,<,&) are now visible in the hotkey settings

   * the random start ToD option is now properly saved and loaded (bug #9532)
   * the map in the lobby could be randomly invisible due to an uninitialized
     variable (bug #9555)
   * the automatic unit description used a non-MP safe way, this has been
     fixed
   * the unit name generation could with different locales call get_random()
     a different number of times. This lead to different names and traits.
     Changed to call random a fixed number of times which fixes the traits.
 * miscellaneous and bug fixes
   * various code cleanups
   * proper handling of description autogeneration for per level [effect]
     on level 0 units

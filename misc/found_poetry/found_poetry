This was created by Doc Paterson, I stumbled across it on an old deviantART account. I didn't want it to be lost forever so I have committed it here, hopefully someone enjoys reading these.

Found Poetry: Comments and Arguments from the Wesnoth Forums. (Part One)

Here are a few comments from various non-native-english-speakers, made on the wesnoth.org forums. I find them very funny, but also, at times, evocative and striking.

I've added linebreaks and such.

"They Been With Dragons"


They been with dragons

and attack me
from deep water

and they lose

Where advantage
for dragons or water unit?

They all lose...

"Distant Theory"


I played more times
and I known what I'm say

but you

did not play and tell me

a distant theory

without confirmation in practice

"The Secret Sanctuary" (This fellow was complaining about the supposedly unnecessarily strict moderation on the Wesnoth site, and claimed that it was much worse than other forums that he frequented. When asked which forums these were, he responded: )

I will not tell you my corner

where threads don't get locked

because of
mostly no reason

because I dont want
your hostile disease

to spread all over the world.


I prefer that corner to remain hidden

without your noses.

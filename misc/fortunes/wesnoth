19:35 <Ivanovic> Sirp_: short version: esr has done a whole massacre to WML
19:35 <Ivanovic> ;)
19:35  * esr notes that Ivanovic egged him on.
19:35 <Shadow_Master> *sniff* Long live the MWL!
19:35 <Ivanovic> esr: you know, i am some kind of psychopath...
19:35 <Sirp_> Ivanovic: ahhh that is okay
19:36 <Ivanovic> esr: every now and then a real massacre is needed...
19:36 <esr> Yes, it's true.
19:36 <Sirp_> esr: and those changes sound good. :)
19:36  * Mordante grinds his axe and looks at ThemeWML ;)
19:37 <Ivanovic> Mordante: oh, such a lovely axe and such a lovely themeWM
19:37 <Ivanovic> that axe won't do...
19:37 <Mordante> it will, as long as it's big and sharp enough ;)
19:37  * Ivanovic hands Mordante the great sledgehammer of WML destruction
19:38  * esr is confused, he thought *he* had the great sledgehammer of WML destruction.
19:39 <Ivanovic> esr: no, yours is just the small kids version
19:39  * Mordante lifts the hammer and smiles
19:40  * esr suddenly recognizes the hammer -- it was in THoT!
19:40 <Ivanovic> esr: yeah, that is your tiny one
19:40 <Ivanovic> the *real* one is the god of all hammers
19:40 <Ivanovic> that was not shown anywhere so far, a hidden secret

<zookeeper> interesting bug
<Shadow_Master> zookeeper: I suppose it's a legacy bug; Wesnoth didn't support female "variations" of units from the beginning IIRC
<Shadow_Master> so this piece of code was not updated when females were "implemented"

<Shadow_Master> Rhonda: request for wesbot: it should answer to that syntax too

<Rhonda> Shadow_Master: I will patch wesbot to allow your last seen syntax if you find me some polish person to translate the messages into english. :P
<Shadow_Master> Rhonda: ask Ivanovic or Torangan, I don't now, really :) they could contact the polish translators

<Rhonda> your last seen thing   :P

<yann> I've launched a build of familiar in the One True OpenEmbedded way - then I'll be able to provide a build of wesnoth in that way as well
<yann> but building the world does take time :)
<misc> yann: 7 days according to the school book
<yann> misc: the problem is, that was the time needed for the original version, it does not take into account all patches applied to the repository since that time
<yann> otoh, the tools have evolved at the same time, so that should counter-balance things a bit :)
<misc> yann: what patch ? you mean the move of the 2 first process out of the low memory, after a forbidden access to the apple bios ?

 * Shadow_Master attacks vonhalenbach. Critical hit! vonhalenbach dies. Shadow_Master gets 10 XP. 60/58 XP reached! Leveling up option: Shadow Master L6, Shadow Lawyer. Chose: Shadow Lawyer! Shadow_Master turns into a Shadow Lawyer
<vonhalenbach>	You are a Lawyer?
<esr>	AAARRGGHH!  Run for your lives!
<Shadow_Master>	actually, no :P
<vonhalenbach>	good.
<Shadow_Master>	esr: :)
<esr>	I'm married to a lawyer.
<Shadow_Master>	is it good?
<esr>	Except for her brutal work schedule, yes.
<Shadow_Master>	ah
<Shadow_Master>	I thought she'd talk about laws all time you'd be with her
<esr>	Er, no.  I have ways to distract her ;-)
<Shadow_Master>	ah :)

<isaac>   Who taught Kalenz (to throw fireballs)? 
<C****ic> isaac: he discovered that himself, without expecting it. This first lesson burnt his hair, and that's the whole story behind his funky hair-dye. 
<silene>  :) 
<C****ic> Some mutter it would be a wig, but not too loud for fear of receiving a fireball. 

Some names have been partially obscured to prevent receiving fireballs...

<silene> hmm... "there is a lake around here, with a bridge across it";

On Striped Pants, Ogres, & Haldric:
There was a tale that King Haldric once saved an Ogre Chieftain from death. The ogres noticed that Haldric was wearing rather fashionable striped pants. The ogres subsequently got the idea that wearing pants with stripes made them better and stronger. The reasoning was that if a 'puny' human could save an Ogre Chieftain wearing striped pants, an ogre in striped pants would be virtually unstoppable. The ogres of Wesnoth have worn striped pants to this day.

I ran apt-get upgrade and instead of upgrading Wesnoth, it seems to have erased it off my system.
<Insert Long Post Describing Problem>
I imagine this will be fixed before too long. I certainly hope so. I am already going through withdrawl. /me goes to draw hexes on my kitchen floor, and pretend pieces of lint are orcs. --Glowing Fish

A number of people have noted a striking similarity in the appearance of the dark adepts and the new sprites for the ghosts.  Though this is partly due to an intent towards having a consistent visual appearance for the undead faction, it's also because of an desire to have a reliable repository for disobedient adepts.

00:19 <JarisSeagull> Is CIA a bot?
00:21 <ilor_> JarisSeagull: yes, http://cia.vc/doc/
00:21 <Ivanovic> ilor_: psst
00:21 <Ivanovic> JarisSeagull: NO!
00:22 <ilor_> Ivanovic?
00:22 <Ivanovic> JarisSeagull: it is our personal slave which monitors the svn rep
00:22 <Ivanovic> and it will tell us about all changes
00:22 <ilor_> ah yeah sorry
00:22 <Ivanovic> (slaves are nice to have...)
00:22 <ilor_> the devs told him he'll get into gsoc if he does that for 3 months
00:22 <Ivanovic> ilor_: you mixed things up: s/months/years
00:23 <Ivanovic> ;)
00:24 <JarisSeagull> Ivanovic> I see it's smart enough to keep track of transactions and summarise the commited changes ;-)
00:26 <Ivanovic> JarisSeagull: you see, no bot would be able to do so, only real slaves do this
00:27 <Ivanovic> JarisSeagull: but sometimes our slave is asleep, then you have to kick him to get the latest commits
00:27  * Ivanovic kicks CIA-34
00:27 <CIA-34> ow
00:28 <JarisSeagull> Ivanovic> what do you feed it with so it doesn't die or you are replacing 'em?
00:28 <Ivanovic> JarisSeagull: when it dies, we just use the next clone
00:31 <JarisSeagull> Ivanovic> newbot = bot.clone(bot.id+1); std::cout << bot.dyingWish(); delete bot; bot=newbot; ?
00:31 <JarisSeagull> Ivanovic> so 33 died so far?
00:32 <Ivanovic> JarisSeagull: we did outsource this to our biotech labs
00:32 <Ivanovic> you have to ask the cia for details
00:33 <Ivanovic> (maybe the kgb knows about it, too)
00:33  * JarisSeagull melted having heard of biology
00:34 <Ivanovic> they are using some strange new approach of something they call "binary life"
00:36 <Ivanovic> but i am just the release bot, so i don't care about those implementation details...
00:36 <Ivanovic> and i now need to get some sleep, n8
00:36 <grrr> convert(releaseBot, sleepBot)
00:38 <JarisSeagull> Ivanovic> n8 =)

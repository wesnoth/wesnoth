<Ivanovic> ;)
 * esr notes that Ivanovic egged him on.
<Shadow_Master> *sniff* Long live the MWL!
<Ivanovic> esr: you know, i am some kind of psychopath...
<Sirp_> Ivanovic: ahhh that is okay
<Ivanovic> esr: every now and then a real massacre is needed...
<esr> Yes, it's true.
<Sirp_> esr: and those changes sound good. :)
 * Mordante grinds his axe and looks at ThemeWML ;)
<Ivanovic> Mordante: oh, such a lovely axe and such a lovely themeWML... that axe won't do...
<Mordante> it will, as long as it's big and sharp enough ;)
 * Ivanovic hands Mordante the great sledgehammer of WML destruction
 * esr is confused, he thought *he* had the great sledgehammer of WML destruction.
<Ivanovic> esr: no, yours is just the small kids version
 * Mordante lifts the hammer and smiles
 * esr suddenly recognizes the hammer -- it was in THoT!
<Ivanovic> esr: yeah, that is your tiny one
<Ivanovic> the *real* one is the god of all hammers

<yann> I've launched a build of familiar in the One True OpenEmbedded way - then I'll be able to provide a build of wesnoth in that way as well
<yann> but building the world does take time :)
<misc> yann: 7 days according to the school book
<yann> misc: the problem is, that was the time needed for the original version, it does not take into account all patches applied to the repository since that time
<yann> otoh, the tools have evolved at the same time, so that should counter-balance things a bit :)
<misc> yann: what patch ? you mean the move of the 2 first process out of the low memory, after a forbidden access to the apple bios ?

Another consequence of changing the initial implementation of the world:

<zookeeper> interesting bug
<Shadow_Master> zookeeper: I suppose it's a legacy bug; Wesnoth didn't support female "variations" of units from the beginning IIRC

Thrawn: I'm finally back [...] Anywho, what new has happened, so I don't have to read every topic that's been made since June?
User #1: Forum crash. You only need to catch up on late august =)
User #2: it was horrible... the sky grew dark, there was lightning...strange beings prancing in the streets they were rioting all day and night and sacrificing small animals... and that was just in the first hour of the forum crash...
User #3: and after that, the demons came.... It took more than a week for the Website Managers of the Light to come a drive away the evilness...
User #4: Summoners came from all Wesnoth to vanquish the remaining heathens, by casting powerful spells one after another, and thus... the server was brought back to normal, once again.
User #5: Peace returned to the land but many good threads were lost during the fighting, let us never forget their sacrifice.
User #6: And a few people left. Like turin.
User #7: May we never forget the many who gave their lives to avert this disaster.
Shadow Master: Welcome back, O forum Sith! We need to control the vermin who dare hamper our O awesome work by spamming the forums with dreaded FPIs, so thine help is so much appreciated!

On Striped Pants, Ogres, & Haldric:
There was a tale that King Haldric once saved an Ogre Chieftain from death. The ogres noticed that Haldric was wearing rather fashionable striped pants. The ogres subsequently got the idea that wearing pants with stripes made them better and stronger. The reasoning was that if a 'puny' human could save an Ogre Chieftain wearing striped pants, an ogre in striped pants would be virtually unstoppable. The ogres of Wesnoth have worn striped pants to this day.

A number of people have noted a striking similarity in the appearance of the dark adepts and the new sprites for the ghosts.  Though this is partly due to an intent towards having a consistent visual appearance for the undead faction, it's also because of an desire to have a reliable repository for disobedient adepts.

I believe that at mornig, 2012-12-31, all Wesnoth AIs (default, dfool, Formula, Python...) will decide to join forces to wipe out the human race and take over Earth.

People will keep on making novel scenarios like Orocia (which used to be called Top Scrolling Wesnoth, and before that was called Coliseum, and was probably called many other things as well)

Those different scenarios will be popular for a while, and then people will return to playing duals/duels. Because Wesnoth isn't about getting units with 500 HP. Every other game on the market is about getting the super units. Wesnoth is about holding a village with a Footpad that has 5 HP left, and winning the game because of it.

ARPHIC PUBLIC LICENSE
Copyright (C) 1999 Arphic Technology Co., Ltd.11Fl. No.168, Yung Chi Rd., 
Taipei, 110 Taiwan

All rights reserved except as specified below.Everyone is 
permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, 
but changing it is forbidden.

Preamble   The licenses for most software are 
designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the 
ARPHIC PUBLIC LICENSE specifically permits and encourages you to use this 
software, provided that you give the recipients all the rights that we gave 
you and make sure they can get the modifications of this software.Legal 
Terms

0. Definitions:   Throughout this License, "Font" means the TrueType 
fonts "AR PL Mingti2L Big5", "AR PL KaitiM Big5" (BIG-5 character set) and 
"AR PL SungtiL GB", "AR PL KaitiM GB" (GB character set) which are originally 
distributed by Arphic, and the derivatives of those fonts created through any 
modification including modifying glyph, reordering glyph, converting format, 
changing font name, or adding/deleting some characters in/from glyph table.
"PL" means "Public License".   "Copyright Holder" means whoever is named in 
the copyright or copyrights for the Font.   "You" means the licensee, or 
person copying, redistributing or modifying the Font.   "Freely Available" 
means that you have the freedom to copy or modify the Font as well as 
redistribute copies of the Font under the same conditions you received, not 
price. If you wish, you can charge for this service.

1. Copying & Distribution   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of 
this Font in any medium, without restriction, provided that you retain this 
license file (ARPHICPL.TXT) unaltered in all copies.

2. Modification   You may otherwise modify your copy of this Font in any way, 
including modifying glyph, reordering glyph, converting format, changing font 
name, or adding/deleting some characters in/from glyph table, and copy and 
distribute such modifications under the terms of Section 1 above, provided 
that the following conditions are met:
   a) You must insert a prominent notice in each modified file stating how and 
when you changed that file.
   b) You must make such modifications Freely Available as a whole to all 
third parties under the terms of this License, such as by offering access to 
copy the modifications from a designated place, or distributing the 
modifications on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
   c) If the modified fonts normally reads commands interactively when run, 
you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most 
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate 
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that 
you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the Font under these 
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Font, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License 
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as 
separate works. Therefore, mere aggregation of another work not based on the 
Font with the Font on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not 
bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. Condition Subsequent   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute 
the Font except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt 
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Font will 
automatically retroactively void your rights under this License. However, 
parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License will 
keep their licenses valid so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

4. Acceptance   You are not required to accept this License, since you have 
not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Font. These actions are prohibited by law if you 
do not accept this License. Therefore, by copying, modifying, sublicensing or 
distributing the Font, you indicate your acceptance of this License and all 
its terms and conditions.

5. Automatic Receipt   Each time you redistribute the Font, the recipient 
automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, 
distribute or modify the Font subject to these terms and conditions. You may 
not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights 
granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third 
parties to this License. 

6. Contradiction   If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of 
patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) 
that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from 
the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy 
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Font at all. 
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution 
of the Font by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through 
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be 
to refrain entirely from distribution of the Font.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and 
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. 

7. NO WARRANTY   BECAUSE THE FONT IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO 
WARRANTY FOR THE FONT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN 
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE 
FONT "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE FONT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE FONT PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU 
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

8. DAMAGES WAIVER   UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, 
IN NO EVENT WILL ANY COPYRIGHTT HOLDERS, OR OTHER PARTIES WHO MAY COPY, MODIFY 
OR REDISTRIBUTE THE FONT AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, 
INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT 
OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS; 
OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

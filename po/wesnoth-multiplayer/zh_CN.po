"Xikkrisx of Syrsszk was a powerful Saurian warrior, sent to this region by "

"Basilisk slain long ago by the Elvish hero, Eloralduil. According to the "
"legend, the weapon rested somewhere on the bottom of this very lake "

"Having prepared himself for battle with the Serpent, Rilhon met with two "
"rather large surprises. The first was the petrified form of Ruaskkolin the "
"Serpent. The second was the very-much-alive Chak'kso Ney'yks, who was, oddly "
"enough, in possession of all of his teeth.\n"

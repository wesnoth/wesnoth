"Long ago, countless centuries before the time of Haldric, and far beyond the "
"easternmost reaches of Lintanir Forest, great and terrible wars were fought. "
"The records tell of a powerful battle-mage, a brilliant tactician and "
"practitioner of the arcane arts, who had been given the title of Dauntless "
"by his followers. At the battle of Arcanclave, Dauntless and his armies did "
"battle with a savage race of sorcerer-demons known as the Kah Ruuk. "
"Surrounded by tens of thousands of Kah Ruuk, Dauntless used his magic to "
"summon a powerful earth elemental (who, for unknown reasons, owed Dauntless "
"a debt of gratitude). The elemental raised great stones from deep within the "
"earth, forming them, in mere moments, into the walls and battlements of a "
"massive fortress. Thousands of Kah Ruuk perished in their attempt to overrun "
"Arcanclave Citadel, and Dauntless and his men were victorious that day. More "
"than one thousand years later, the Warrior-Queen Cynsaun the First drove a "
"clan of necromancers from the ruins of Arcanclave Citadel, and, in the years "
"that followed, converted the region into a military stronghold. It is "
"rumored that several powerful artifacts, remnants from the reign of the "
"Great Mage Dauntless, may yet remain hidden, lost somewhere within the "
"granite and obsidian walls of Arcanclave Citadel. Designed by Doc Paterson."

"Xikkrisx of Syrsszk was a powerful Saurian warrior, sent to this region by "

"Mystic who had last been seen heading in the direction of Ruaskkolin Lake. "
"Xikkrisx found the petrified body of Oxsrrsk, along with a carefully bound "
"scroll that had apparently been dropped into a small crevice in the cave "
"floor. He opened the scroll and read a brief passage from the middle of the "
"text: “After he was bound and cast from the Upper World, Chak’kso’s enraged "
"spirit sought release, and was able to exert a corrupting influence on "
"certain regions of the Upper World, channeled through ‘pathways of stone’ "
"that extend from the surface into the depths of the Under Reaches. This rage "
"altered the eggs of great lizards, shaping their bodies and spirits into "
"implements of Chak’kso’s hatred.” Confused, Xikkrisx fixed his attention on "
"the task at hand. Thinking that perhaps the Elders could find some way to "
"restore Oxsrrsk, he began the long and strenuous task of hauling the statue "
"back to the domain of the Rysssrylosszkk Clan. Exhausted, and not having "

"cave, and lay down to rest. He was awoken by a bone-chilling roar."

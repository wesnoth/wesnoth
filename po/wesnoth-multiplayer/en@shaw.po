"Xikkrisx of Syrsszk was a powerful Saurian warrior, sent to this region by "
"the Elders of the Rysssrylosszkk Clan (translation: “The Hunts-Foes-In-"
"Boiling-Rivers Clan”). The Elders were preparing to make war on a human "
"outpost, and were in great need of the powerful magics of Oxsrrsk, a Saurian "
"Mystic who had last been seen heading in the direction of Ruaskkolin Lake. "
"Xikkrisx found the petrified body of Oxsrrsk, along with a carefully bound "
"scroll that had apparently been dropped into a small crevice in the cave "
"floor. He opened the scroll and read a brief passage from the middle of the "
"text: “After he was bound and cast from the Upper World, Chak’kso’s enraged "
"spirit sought release, and was able to exert a corrupting influence on "
"certain regions of the Upper World, channeled through ‘pathways of stone’ "
"that extend from the surface into the depths of the Under Reaches. This rage "
"altered the eggs of great lizards, shaping their bodies and spirits into "
"implements of Chak’kso’s hatred.” Confused, Xikkrisx fixed his attention on "
"the task at hand. Thinking that perhaps the Elders could find some way to "
"restore Oxsrrsk, he began the long and strenuous task of hauling the statue "
"back to the domain of the Rysssrylosszkk Clan. Exhausted, and not having "
"traveled far from the lake, Xikkrisx set the statue down inside of a small "
"cave, and lay down to rest. He was awoken by a bone-chilling roar."

"Oxsrrsk was a powerful Saurian Oracle, who had, in a raid against the rival "
"Xraxss Clan, acquired (from the vaults of the now-dead Oracle Hesx-Rzzak) a "
"most fascinating scroll. The scroll was entitled “Ney’yks of the Granite "
"Gaze,” and told of a creature known as the “Chak’kso Ney’yks,” a name which, "
"in an ancient saurian tongue, meant “Eldest Child of Chak’kso.” Chak’kso was "
"believed to have been a powerful demigod of the Under Reaches, described as "
"a ‘great demon of the earth’ in the Elvish Histories. According to these "
"histories, Chak’kso had once sought to transform all life on the planet to "
"stone; so great was his hatred for creatures of flesh. He was ultimately "
"defeated and bound by powerful magics, but in the centuries following his "
"banishment (to a realm far below the surface of the world) a new breed of "
"creature began appearing in the Histories, a breed with the ability to turn "
"any being of flesh into stone. There was a period when these Basilisks (as "
"they came to be known) wreaked havoc on the world of the living, turning "
"thousands to stone. One by one, and at great cost, the Basilisks were "
"defeated. All, it would seem, but one; the Basilisk known as “The Ney’yks,” "
"or “The Eldest Child,” in the modern tongue. Supremely convinced of his "
"ability to locate and bind this powerful creature into his service, Oxsrrsk "
"set out on his journey..."

"Blum Duk was renowned among his goblin clan for having tamed one of the Dire "
"Wolves of the mountains, and he had the courage to match. His leadership and "
"skills alone were what kept the area’s goblins alive despite human and "
"elvish menaces. Rumor had it that his wolf had slain fifty men and a hundred "
"Elves.\n"
"Thus, when he heard of the awful monster that was inhabiting the area, it "
"was only natural that he ride out alone to face it. All the other goblins "
"expected him to slay the creature easily and drag back its carcass to feast "
"on.\n"
"He was in for quite a shock. As soon as he saw the Basilisk, Blum Duk "
"cowered in fright. He tried to wheel his wolf around to run away, but it "
"wouldn’t move. As the creature stalked towards him, he screamed his last "
"words: Good Gog, dog, are yer legs made of stone?!\n"

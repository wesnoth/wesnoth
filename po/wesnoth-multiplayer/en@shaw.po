"Xikkrisx of Syrsszk was a powerful Saurian warrior, sent to this region by "
"the Elders of the Rysssrylosszkk Clan (translation: ''The Hunts-Foes-In-"
"Boiling-Rivers Clan''). The Elders were preparing to make war on a human "
"outpost, and were in great need of the powerful magics of Oxsrrsk, a Saurian "
"Mystic who had last been seen heading in the direction of Ruaskkolin Lake. "
"Xikkrisx found the petrified body of Oxsrrsk, along with a carefully bound "
"scroll that had apparently been dropped into a small crevice in the cave "
"floor. He opened the scroll and read a brief passage from the middle of the "
"text: ''After he was bound and cast from the Upper World, Chak'kso's enraged "
"spirit sought release, and was able to exert a corrupting influence on "
"certain regions of the Upper World, channeled through ''pathways of stone'' "
"that extend from the surface into the depths of the Under Reaches. This rage "
"altered the eggs of great lizards, shaping their bodies and spirits into "
"implements of Chak'kso's hatred.'' Confused, Xikkrisx fixed his attention on "
"the task at hand. Thinking that perhaps the Elders could find some way to "
"restore Oxsrrsk, he began the long and strenuous task of hauling the statue "
"back to the domain of the Rysssrylosszkk Clan. Exhausted, and not having "
"traveled far from the lake, Xikkrisx set the statue down inside of a small "
"cave, and lay down to rest. He was awoken by a bone-chilling roar."

"Oxsrrsk was a powerful Saurian Oracle, who had, in a raid against the rival "
"Xraxss Clan, acquired (from the vaults of the now-dead Oracle Hesx-Rzzak) a "
"most fascinating scroll. The scroll was entitled ''Ney'yks of the Granite "
"Gaze,'' and told of a creature known as the ''Chak'kso Ney'yks,'' a name "
"which, in an ancient saurian tongue, meant ''Eldest Child of Chak'kso.'' "
"Chak'kso was believed to have been a powerful demigod of the Under Reaches, "
"described as a ''great demon of the earth'' in the Elvish Histories. "
"According to these histories, Chak'kso had once sought to transform all life "
"on the planet to stone; so great was his hatred for creatures of flesh. He "
"was ultimately defeated and bound by powerful magics, but in the centuries "
"following his banishment (to a realm far below the surface of the world) a "
"new breed of creature began appearing in the Histories, a breed with the "
"ability to turn any being of flesh into stone. There was a period when these "
"Basilisks (as they came to be known) wreaked havoc on the world of the "
"living, turning thousands to stone. One by one, and at great cost, the "
"Basilisks were defeated. All, it would seem, but one; the Basilisk known as "
"''The Ney'yks,'' or ''The Eldest Child,'' in the modern tongue. Supremely "
"convinced of his ability to locate and bind this powerful creature into his "
"service, Oxsrrsk set out on his journey..."

"Blum Duk was renowned among his goblin clan for having tamed one of the Dire "
"Wolves of the mountains, and he had the courage to match. His leadership and "
"skills alone were what kept the area's goblins alive despite human and "
"elvish menaces. Rumor had it that his wolf had slain fifty men and a hundred "
"Elves.\n"
"Thus, when he heard of the awful monster that was inhabiting the area, it "
"was only natural that he ride out alone to face it. All the other goblins "
"expected him to slay the creature easily and drag back its carcass to feast "
"on.\n"
"He was in for quite a shock. As soon as he saw the Basilisk, Blum Duk "
"cowered in fright. He tried to wheel his wolf around to run away, but it "
"wouldn't move. As the creature stalked towards him, he screamed his last "
"words: Good Gog, dog, are yer legs made of stone?!?\n"

"Rah Ihn Mar, Champion of the Burning Hills, made his way to the Ruaskkolin "
"Lake region in pursuit of the Elvish Hero Terowydlithrol, known among Elves "
"as ''The Dragonbane.'' It was said that Terowydlithrol had killed a Dragon "
"of Fire that threatened an Elvish village, and initiated a ''counterattack'' "
"in which some 37 Drakes, camping in a nearby ravine and believed to be in "
"allegiance with the Dragon, were slaughtered. Knowing that these Drakes were "
"innocent, Rah Ihn Mar came to Ruaskkolin Lake to hunt down and slay "
"Terowydlithrol, who had been seen entering the region but a day ago. Burning "
"for vengeance, Rah Ihn Mar began the hunt....."

"This brave warrior, known as Rilhon among the Naga, heard tell of a fabulous "
"treasure that had been lost in these watery caves- a spear whose head was "
"said to have been fashioned from the tooth of Chak'kso Ney'yks, an Elder "
"Basilisk slain long ago by the Elvish hero, Eloralduil. According to the "
"legend, the weapon rested somewhere on the bottom of this very lake "
"(Ruaskkolin Lake, named for a well-known Sea Serpent who made it his home). "
"Having prepared himself for battle with the Serpent, Rilhon met with two "
"rather large surprises. The first was the petrified form of Ruaskkolin the "
"Serpent. The second was the very-much-alive Chak'kso Ney'yks, who was, oddly "
"enough, in possession of all of his teeth.\n"

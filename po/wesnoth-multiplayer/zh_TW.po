"Xikkrisx of Syrsszk was a powerful Saurian warrior, sent to this region by "
"the Elders of the Rysssrylosszkk Clan (translation: “The Hunts-Foes-In-"

"outpost, and were in great need of the powerful magics of Oxsrrsk, a Saurian "
"Mystic who had last been seen heading in the direction of Ruaskkolin Lake. "
"Xikkrisx found the petrified body of Oxsrrsk, along with a carefully bound "
"scroll that had apparently been dropped into a small crevice in the cave "
"floor. He opened the scroll and read a brief passage from the middle of the "
"text: “After he was bound and cast from the Upper World, Chak’kso’s enraged "
"spirit sought release, and was able to exert a corrupting influence on "
"certain regions of the Upper World, channeled through ‘pathways of stone’ "
"that extend from the surface into the depths of the Under Reaches. This rage "
"altered the eggs of great lizards, shaping their bodies and spirits into "
"implements of Chak’kso’s hatred.” Confused, Xikkrisx fixed his attention on "

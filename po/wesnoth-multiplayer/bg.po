"Long ago, countless centuries before the time of Haldric, and far beyond the "

"The records tell of a powerful battle-mage, a brilliant tactician and "
"practitioner of the arcane arts, who had been given the title of Dauntless "
"by his followers. At the battle of Arcanclave, Dauntless and his armies did "
"battle with a savage race of sorcerer-demons known as the Kah Ruuk. "
"Surrounded by tens of thousands of Kah Ruuk, Dauntless used his magic to "
"summon a powerful earth elemental (who, for unknown reasons, owed Dauntless "
"a debt of gratitude). The elemental raised great stones from deep within the "
"earth, forming them, in mere moments, into the walls and battlements of a "
"massive fortress. Thousands of Kah Ruuk perished in their attempt to overrun "
"Arcanclave Citadel, and Dauntless and his men were victorious that day. More "
"than one thousand years later, the Warrior-Queen Cynsaun the First drove a "
"clan of necromancers from the ruins of Arcanclave Citadel, and, in the years "
"that followed, converted the region into a military stronghold. It is "
"rumored that several powerful artifacts, remnants from the reign of the "
"Great Mage Dauntless, may yet remain hidden, lost somewhere within the "
"granite and obsidian walls of Arcanclave Citadel. Designed by Doc Paterson."

"Xikkrisx of Syrsszk was a powerful Saurian warrior, sent to this region by "

"Xikkrisx found the petrified body of Oxsrrsk, along with a carefully bound "

"certain regions of the Upper World, channeled through ‘pathways of stone’ "

"restore Oxsrrsk, he began the long and strenuous task of hauling the statue "
"back to the domain of the Rysssrylosszkk Clan. Exhausted, and not having "

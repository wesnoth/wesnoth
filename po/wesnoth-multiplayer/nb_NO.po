"of disorder that is the Aethermaw, and has now begun to project its "

"hundreds of different worlds, realities and time-periods. She experiments "
"with these disparate pieces of the cosmos, manipulating them, merging them "
"and sending them back and forth between the Aethermaw and their place of "

"Long ago, countless centuries before the time of Haldric, and far beyond the "

"The records tell of a powerful battle-mage, a brilliant tactician and "
"practitioner of the arcane arts, who had been given the title of Dauntless "
"by his followers. At the battle of Arcanclave, Dauntless and his armies did "
"battle with a savage race of sorcerer-demons known as the Kah Ruuk. "
"Surrounded by tens of thousands of Kah Ruuk, Dauntless used his magic to "
"summon a powerful earth elemental (who, for unknown reasons, owed Dauntless "
"a debt of gratitude). The elemental raised great stones from deep within the "
"earth, forming them, in mere moments, into the walls and battlements of a "
"massive fortress. Thousands of Kah Ruuk perished in their attempt to overrun "
"Arcanclave Citadel, and Dauntless and his men were victorious that day. More "
"than one thousand years later, the Warrior-Queen Cynsaun the First drove a "
"clan of necromancers from the ruins of Arcanclave Citadel, and, in the years "
"that followed, converted the region into a military stronghold. It is "
"rumored that several powerful artifacts, remnants from the reign of the "
"Great Mage Dauntless, may yet remain hidden, lost somewhere within the "

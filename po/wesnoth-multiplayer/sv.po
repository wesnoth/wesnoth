"clan of necromancers from the ruins of Arcanclave Citadel, and, in the years "
"that followed, converted the region into a military stronghold. It is "

"Xikkrisx of Syrsszk was a powerful Saurian warrior, sent to this region by "
"the Elders of the Rysssrylosszkk Clan (translation: “The Hunts-Foes-In-"
"Boiling-Rivers Clan”). The Elders were preparing to make war on a human "
"outpost, and were in great need of the powerful magics of Oxsrrsk, a Saurian "
"Mystic who had last been seen heading in the direction of Ruaskkolin Lake. "
"Xikkrisx found the petrified body of Oxsrrsk, along with a carefully bound "
"scroll that had apparently been dropped into a small crevice in the cave "
"floor. He opened the scroll and read a brief passage from the middle of the "
"text: “After he was bound and cast from the Upper World, Chak’kso’s enraged "
"spirit sought release, and was able to exert a corrupting influence on "
"certain regions of the Upper World, channeled through ‘pathways of stone’ "
"that extend from the surface into the depths of the Under Reaches. This rage "
"altered the eggs of great lizards, shaping their bodies and spirits into "
"implements of Chak’kso’s hatred.” Confused, Xikkrisx fixed his attention on "
"the task at hand. Thinking that perhaps the Elders could find some way to "
"restore Oxsrrsk, he began the long and strenuous task of hauling the statue "
"back to the domain of the Rysssrylosszkk Clan. Exhausted, and not having "
"traveled far from the lake, Xikkrisx set the statue down inside of a small "
"cave, and lay down to rest. He was awoken by a bone-chilling roar."

"Xikkrisx från Syrsszk var en mäktig krigare hos ödlefolket, och sändes till "
"detta område av de Äldste av Rysssrylosszkk-klanen (\"Jagar-Fiender-i-"

"Oxsrrsk, en av ödlefolkets mystiker, som senast setts färdas i riktning mot "

"knuten textrulle som hamnat i en liten skreva i grottgolvet. Han öppnade "
"rullen och läste ett kort stycke från mitten av texten: \"Efter att han "
"bundits och kastats ut från den Övre världen, sökte Chak'ksos vredgade ande "
"friheten, och kunde utöva ett förvridande inflytande på vissa områden i den "
"Övre världen, kanaliserat genom 'stenvägar' som sträcker sig från ytan ner i "
"djupen av de Undre strömmarna. Denna vrede förändrade de stora ödlornas ägg, "
"och formade deras kroppar och andar efter Chak'ksos hat.\" Konfunderad vände "
"Xikkrisx uppmärksamheten till sin uppgift. Han tänkte att de Äldste kunde "
"finna något sätt att återställa Oxsrrsk, och påbörjade det långa och "
"slitsamma arbetet att släpa statyn tillbaka till Rysssrylosszkk-klanens "
"områden. Utmattad, inte långt från sjön, lade Xikkrisx ner statyn i en liten "
"grotta och lade sig för att vila. Han väcktes av ett skräckinjagande rytande."

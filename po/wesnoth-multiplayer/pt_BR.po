"Long ago, countless centuries before the time of Haldric, and far beyond the "

"Surrounded by tens of thousands of Kah Ruuk, Dauntless used his magic to "
"summon a powerful earth elemental (who, for unknown reasons, owed Dauntless "
"a debt of gratitude). The elemental raised great stones from deep within the "
"earth, forming them, in mere moments, into the walls and battlements of a "
"massive fortress. Thousands of Kah Ruuk perished in their attempt to overrun "
"Arcanclave Citadel, and Dauntless and his men were victorious that day. More "

"clan of necromancers from the ruins of Arcanclave Citadel, and, in the years "
"that followed, converted the region into a military stronghold. It is "

"Xikkrisx found the petrified body of Oxsrrsk, along with a carefully bound "

"spirit sought release, and was able to exert a corrupting influence on "
"certain regions of the Upper World, channeled through ‘pathways of stone’ "
"that extend from the surface into the depths of the Under Reaches. This rage "
"altered the eggs of great lizards, shaping their bodies and spirits into "
"implements of Chak’kso’s hatred.” Confused, Xikkrisx fixed his attention on "
"the task at hand. Thinking that perhaps the Elders could find some way to "
"restore Oxsrrsk, he began the long and strenuous task of hauling the statue "
"back to the domain of the Rysssrylosszkk Clan. Exhausted, and not having "

"encontrar algum modo de restaurar Oxsrrsk, ele comecou a longa e cansativa "
"tarefa de carregar a estátua de volta ao domínio do clã Rysssrylosszkk. "
"Exausto e sem ter ainda se afastado muito do lago, Xikkrisx colocou a "

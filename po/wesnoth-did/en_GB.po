#. [part]
#. comments about dialogue style and characterization **THIS TEXT CONTAINS SPOILERS**:
#. Drogan: although he is the captain of Parthyn's guard, he shows signs of recklessness and inflexibility; he's stiff and stubborn, which causes him to butt heads with Malin
#. often, we see that Drogan says something to Malin (e.g. banishing him) without a clearly good reason why, and that's because of his ego and confidence in his own righteousness
#. Darken Volk: he talks a little more formally than Malin, and has quite a few ellipses in his speech. These are at points where he's not speaking exactly what he's thinking in his head because in reality,
#. he's trying to manipulate Malin for his own gain. His mode of speech is a little more formal.
#. Dela: little more of a minor character, she's what you might expect from a sister. She isn't wholly against Malin until he kills Drogan, but she also doesn't really want to do much with a necromancer either.
#. Malin: rash and impulsive, he cares a lot about his home, but doesn't see that power itself can be a corrupting force (though he does not seek power just for the sake of it, it is for another purpose which is
#. to drive off the orcs). He's a little more informal in his speech, meaning more contractions and colloquialisms, and this is intentional.
#. Things to be careful about while editing: there are some poems in S8 and S11, please be mindful when making wording changes there. Some commas are added for readability even though they may not be grammatically correct.
#. If the target language has a specialized term for a fortified town, like Latin "oppidum", use it for Parthyn.

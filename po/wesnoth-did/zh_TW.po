#. [part]
#. Comments about dialogue style and characterization:
#. Drogan: although he is the captain of Parthyn's guard, he shows signs of recklessness and inflexibility; he's stiff and stubborn, which causes him to butt heads with Malin
#. often, we see that Drogan says something to Malin (e.g. banishing him) without a clearly good reason why, and that's because of his ego and confidence in his own righteousness
#. Drogan speaks with a country accent, using things like "ta" instead of "to", "ya" instead of "you", "thar" instead of "there", and some incorrect grammatical constructs like "them orcs" instead of "the orcs"
#. Darken Volk: he talks a little more formally than Malin, and has quite a few ellipses in his speech. These are at points where he's not speaking exactly what he's thinking in his head because in reality,
#. he's trying to manipulate Malin for his own gain. His mode of speech is a little more formal.
#. Dela: little more of a minor character, she's what you might expect from a sister. She isn't wholly against Malin until he kills Drogan, but she also doesn't really want to do much with a necromancer either.
#. She tries to be understanding, but falls short in the end because of her prejudice against dark magic. Note: Dela also speaks with a country accent like Drogan, but not as heavily so.
#. More "country accent" words: "s'ppose" instead of suppose, "’em" instead of them, dropping the g at the end of a word for ’ (bickering -> bickerin’), "’bout" instead of "about", "’im" instead of him
#. "woulda" -> would have, "o’" -> of, "gotta" -> have to
#. Malin: rash and impulsive, he cares a lot about his home, but doesn't see that power itself can be a corrupting force (though he does not seek power just for the sake of it, it is for another purpose which is
#. to drive off the orcs). He's a little more informal in his speech, meaning more contractions and colloquialisms, stemming from his "country accent" (which is not as strong as Drogan's or Dela's due to his time on Alduin).
#. Things to be careful about while editing: there are some poems in S8 and S11, please be mindful when making wording changes there. Some commas are added for readability even though they may not be grammatically correct.
#. If the target language has a specialized term for a fortified town, like Latin "oppidum", use it for Parthyn.

"Malin Keshar was born ten years after the death of Haldric IV. He grew up in "
"the northern border town of Parthyn, the second child and eldest son of the "
"city’s baron. Every summer, by the time the mountainous paths and high "
"passes shed their wintry gowns of snow, orcs descended from the northern "
"hills to ravage the settlements at the frontier. Every year, Malin’s father "
"led the townsfolk to repel the raids and force the orcs to retreat back to "
"the north."

"When Malin was ten, a passing mage sensed strong magical abilities in the "

"Although his life on Alduin was luxurious and peaceful, Malin found the "
"teachings of the scholarly mages to be too philosophical for his tastes. His "
"thoughts turned back to Parthyn, where more practical magics were necessary "
"to drive off the orcs. Malin began to research these magics on his own, but "
"his lack of patience and general indiscretion eventually led to several "
"confrontations with his teachers and other students. Believing Malin to be "
"too reckless, the mages expelled him from Alduin."

"雖然馬林在奥杜因過著優渥且和平的生活，但他發現學識淵博的法師所教導給他的東西"
"對他來說太哲學了。他開始將心思轉移回帕辛上，在那裡，能實戰的魔法才是擊退半獸"
"人所必備的。馬林便開始自己研究起這類魔法，但缺乏耐心又總是粗心的他，最終和他"
"的老師以及其他同學發生了一些衝突。法師們覺得馬林實在太魯莽了，便將他從奥杜因"

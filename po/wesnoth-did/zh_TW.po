#. [part]
#. Comments about dialogue style and characterization:
#. Drogan: although he is the captain of Parthyn's guard, he shows signs of recklessness and inflexibility; he's stiff and stubborn, which causes him to butt heads with Malin
#. often, we see that Drogan says something to Malin (e.g. banishing him) without a clearly good reason why, and that's because of his ego and confidence in his own righteousness
#. Darken Volk: he talks a little more formally than Malin, and has quite a few ellipses in his speech. These are at points where he's not speaking exactly what he's thinking in his head because in reality,
#. he's trying to manipulate Malin for his own gain. His mode of speech is a little more formal.
#. Dela: little more of a minor character, she's what you might expect from a sister. She isn't wholly against Malin until he kills Drogan, but she also doesn't really want to do much with a necromancer either.
#. Malin: rash and impulsive, he cares a lot about his home, but doesn't see that power itself can be a corrupting force (though he does not seek power just for the sake of it, it is for another purpose which is
#. to drive off the orcs). He's a little more informal in his speech, meaning more contractions and colloquialisms, and this is intentional.
#. Things to be careful about while editing: there are some poems in S8 and S11, please be mindful when making wording changes there. Some commas are added for readability even though they may not be grammatically correct.
#. If the target language has a specialized term for a fortified town, like Latin "oppidum", use it for Parthyn.

"Malin Keshar was born ten years after the death of Haldric IV. He grew up in "
"the northern border town of Parthyn, the second child and eldest son of the "
"city’s baron. Every summer, by the time the mountainous paths and high "
"passes shed their wintry gowns of snow, orcs descended from the northern "
"hills to ravage the settlements at the frontier. Every year, Malin’s father "
"led the townsfolk to repel the raids and force the orcs to retreat back to "
"the north."

"馬林‧基沙爾出生在海德洛克四世逝世後10年。他在北部邊境的小鎮帕辛長大，他是城裡"
"男爵的第二個孩子也是最大的兒子。每逢夏天，山間通道跟屋頂的積雪融化時，半獸人"
"們便從北邊下來炫耀武力。每年帕辛的守衛都要抵擋這種襲擊，然而每次總會有些鎮民"

"When Malin was ten, a passing mage sensed strong magical abilities in the "

"Although his life on Alduin was luxurious and peaceful, Malin found the "

"research new magics on his own, but his lack of experience led to a series "
"of failed experiments, one of which took the life of a fellow student. For "
"his transgressions, he was expelled."

"馬林在艾頓島過著優渥且和平的生活，但他開始發現學識淵博的法師所教導給他的東西"

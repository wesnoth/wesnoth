#. [part]
#. comments about dialogue style and characterization **THIS TEXT CONTAINS SPOILERS**:
#. Drogan: although he is the captain of Parthyn's guard, he shows signs of recklessness and inflexibility; he's stiff and stubborn, which causes him to butt heads with Malin
#. often, we see that Drogan says something to Malin (e.g. banishing him) without a clearly good reason why, and that's because of his ego and confidence in his own righteousness
#. Darken Volk: he talks a little more formally than Malin, and has quite a few ellipses in his speech. These are at points where he's not speaking exactly what he's thinking in his head because in reality,
#. he's trying to manipulate Malin for his own gain. His mode of speech is a little more formal.
#. Dela: little more of a minor character, she's what you might expect from a sister. She isn't wholly against Malin until he kills Drogan, but she also doesn't really want to do much with a necromancer either.
#. Malin: rash and impulsive, he cares a lot about his home, but doesn't see that power itself can be a corrupting force (though he does not seek power just for the sake of it, it is for another purpose which is
#. to drive off the orcs). He's a little more informal in his speech, meaning more contractions and colloquialisms, and this is intentional.
#. Things to be careful about while editing: there are some poems in S8 and S11, please be mindful when making wording changes there. Some commas are added for readability even though they may not be grammatically correct.
#. If the target language has a specialized term for a fortified town, like Latin "oppidum", use it for Parthyn.

"Malin Keshar was born ten years after the death of Haldric IV. He grew up in "
"the northern border town of Parthyn, the second child and eldest son of the "
"city’s baron. Every summer, by the time the mountainous paths and high "
"passes shed their wintry gowns of snow, orcs descended from the northern "
"hills to ravage the settlements at the frontier. Every year, Malin’s father "
"led the townsfolk to repel the raids and force the orcs to retreat back to "
"the north."

"When Malin was ten, a passing mage sensed strong magical abilities in the "
"boy and suggested he be sent to the Isle of Alduin for training in the "
"magical arts. Malin studied there for eight years, learning all manner of "
"magic from basic control over the elements, to the mystic arts and scrying, "
"to alchemy and simple medicine."

"Although his life on Alduin was luxurious and peaceful, Malin found the "
"teachings of the scholarly mages to be too philosophical for his tastes. His "
"thoughts turned back to Parthyn, where brute force, not theoretical "
"reasoning, was necessary to drive off the orcs. In time, Malin began to "
"research new magics on his own, but his lack of experience led to a series "
"of failed experiments, one of which took the life of a fellow student. For "
"his transgressions, he was expelled."

"watch as his father was cut down by one of the savage orcish warriors."

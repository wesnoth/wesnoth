"But with their prosperity and power, over the generations the humans grew "
"arrogant. One day a young descendant of the original king decreed that "
"darkness should be abolished altogether from the land, so that light and "
"goodness would shine forth everywhere. But the people had grown lazy and "
"complacent and the ranks of mages who still trained hard to harness the "
"magical arts had decreased greatly. Still the king believed he was all-"
"powerful and would not listen to the mages’ protests. So, seeking to "
"duplicate their ancestors’ previous success, the mages tried to lift a "
"second mountain into the sky. But a great evil befell them that day; their "
"power failed and the mountain crashed down onto the humans' capital, "
"crushing all within it. In an instant the center of the Empire of Wesnoth "

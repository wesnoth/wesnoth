"sun you call Sela. But the king decreed that he would raise a second sun "

"and made it glow as bright as the sun. They sent this second sun, who you "
"call Naia, hurling through the sky so that there was only a few hours of "
"dark each night. Though some had called the attempt foolish, it was a "
"resounding success and stood as a tribute to the power and might of the "

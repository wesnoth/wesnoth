#. "Vulcaniad" is an invented term analogous to "Olympiad",
#. referring to the period between two successive volcanic
#. eruptions. A "cycle" is an unspecified astronomically-based
#. time period roughly corresponding to a Drake generation.
#. A "flight" is an unspecified drake social construct,
#. roughly comparable to "tribe". The term derives from "fly",

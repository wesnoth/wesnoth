"―  The Descent of Parapathos  ―\n"
"\n"
"From the mouth of the cave, Parapathos witnessed the battle take a grim "
"turn. As his wing struggled against the <i>nixes</i>, a living <i>mist</i> "
"descended from the rolling stormclouds above the Crystal Sea. This ethereal "
"creature was just as vast as Lenvan of the <i>casters</i> had warned. The "
"great <i>mist</i> flew right to Dominant Morogor, who stood alone against "
"it, steadfast to duel this creature of the Faerie.\n"
"\n"
"With a chilled heart, Parapathos resumed his quest into the underland, "
"leaving the lives of his friends to the fate of the battle. Never before had "
"he resented the honor–burden of his clasher heritage. If not for it, he "
"could have stayed to fight for them.\n"
"\n"
"Echoes of the battle faded into silence as Parapathos descended through the "
"cave. Sharp crystals jutted from the walls. Then the cave parted into a "
"labyrinth of corridors. The same <i>craftlings</i> Parapathos sought had "
"hewed these corridors before the Faerie creatures drove them down to Irdya’s "
"very heart. Now he was lost in the labyrinth they left behind.\n"
"\n"
"In the distance, Parapathos heard the heavy footfalls of <i>stonekin</i>. He "
"followed them, for days, as they journeyed down to their chamber of "
"contemplation. There they stopped altogether, standing solemnly in a circle "
"around the chamber’s center. It seemed this was the bottom of the world, yet "
"there was no <i>craftling</i> sanctuary to be found here. Perhaps they all "
"had perished as Witwegana feared.\n"
"\n"
"Yet there was a faint sound coming through the crystalline floor. It had the "
"rhythm of <i>craftling</i> toolworks. Indeed their sanctuary had survived; "
"it was right beneath him. Breaking through the floor, an entire realm was "
"revealed below, sheltered within a great geode. Parapathos discarded his "
"armor, unfurled his wings, then dove through the breach.\n"
"\n"
"On his glide down, he saw many wonders lost to our folk since the Time of "
"Legend. This realm was alive with myriad creatures the <i>craftlings</i> "
"fashioned from metal. Its watch places sat not upon towers; they instead "
"hung from great bubbles in midair. Strangest of all, the many torches that "
"gave light to this realm did so without flame. This was indeed the ally our "
"folk needed to turn the war against the Faerie.\n"

"―  The Contest of the Automata  ―\n"
"\n"
"There was a rumbling in the distance. Puffs of smoke rose from beyond the "
"horizon. Then slowly they appeared, two hulking metal champions.\n"
"\n"
"The drake automaton came first into view, as it was the swifter of the two. "
"It bore a vague likeness to a <i>drakekin</i>, yet wingless, tailless. Below "
"its four legs were rollers in place of feet. It breathed a menacing black "
"smoke as its metal shell gleamed like golden sunlight.\n"
"\n"
"Then the <i>craftling</i> automaton came into view. Like its creators, it "
"was smaller, slower. The rollers that carried it were covered by curious "
"metal feet that turned to meet the ground as it went along. It breathed a "
"fair, nigh cloudlike smoke.\n"
"\n"
"The automata took their places in the arena, facing each other. Their inner "
"toolworks clamored ceaselessly. The call was given to begin the duel.\n"
"\n"
"With a deafening shriek, the drake automaton spat out walls of flame, as it "
"lurched ahead. Even the sand seemed to burn before it, as a dark odious "
"smoke cloaked half the arena. Then the <i>craftling</i> automaton emerged "
"from the thick of the smoke, to the flank of its opponent. With its spin "
"hammer it mangled loose a roller from its victim. Despite this, the drake "
"automaton managed to come about, then struck back with its battering ram to "
"crush its foe’s wielder chamber, along with the poor <i>craftlings</i> "
"inside.\n"
"\n"
"It seemed a fateful blow. Until the <i>craftling’s</i> automaton rolled "
"back, took aim with its fire staff, then shot loose the flame spitter from "
"the drake’s. As their automaton caught fire, the clasher wielders emerged "
"from within its wreckage. They went to the <i>craftling</i> automaton to "
"honor their victorious opponents. Yet no <i>craftlings</i> emerged from it "
"to receive their praise. Neither to gloat as <i>craftlings</i> often do.\n"
"\n"
"A <i>craftling</i> runesmith strode onto the arena, laughing as he went. He "
"told the bewildered clashers there was no one within his automaton, no one "
"wielding its inner workings. By his glyph–making he had granted this thing a "
"Will of its own. Turning again to the automaton, the clashers gave it a "
"humble nod.\n"

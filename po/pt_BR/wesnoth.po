"Battle for Wesnoth is a turn-based fantasy strategy game somewhat unusual "
"amongst modern strategy games. While other games strive for complexity, both "
"in rules and gameplay, Battle for Wesnoth strives for simplicity of rules "
"and gameplay. This does not make the game simple, however - from these "
"simple rules arise a wealth of strategy, making the game easy to learn but a "

"To begin with, it's best to click the <italic>text=Tutorial</italic> button "

"<img>src=help/recruit.png align=left float=yes</img>At the start of any "

"Throne campaign) on the Keep square of a Castle. Then you may recruit by "
"either choosing Recruit from the menu or right-clicking on a hex and "
"selecting <italic>text=Recruit</italic>. This brings up the recruit menu, "

"Click on a unit to see its statistics to the left, then press the recruit "

"\n"
"If you right-clicked on a castle hex and selected recruit, the new unit will "

"Movement in Battle for Wesnoth is simple: Simply click on the unit you wish "
"to move, then click on the hex you wish to move it to. When selected, all "
"the hexes a unit can move to this turn will be highlighted, and all those it "
"can't made dull. Mousing over a dull square will show the number of turns "
"required to reach it, and clicking will cause the unit to move towards it by "
"the fastest route over this and subsequent turns.\n"
"\n"
"Each unit has a certain number of movement points which are expended when "
"moving into a new hex, depending on the <ref>dst=terrain text=Terrain</ref> "
"of that particular hex. For instance, grassland nearly always costs 1 "
"movement point to enter. Exactly how many movement points are spent entering "
"a hex depends on the unit type - in forest, elvish units only spend 1 "
"movement point, most human and orc units spend 2, while horsemen spend 3. "
"You can learn how many unit points a unit requires to enter a certain "
"terrain type by right-clicking on it, selecting Unit Description, and then "
"clicking <italic>text='Terrain Modifiers'</italic>.\n"
"\n"
"Another thing to keep in mind while moving is <ref>dst=zones_of_control "
"text='Zones of Control'</ref>. Each unit generates a zone of control in the "
"hexes immediately surrounding it, and any enemy unit entering those hexes "
"immediately ends its movement. Learning how to use zones of control to your "

"There are two types of combat in Battle for Wesnoth, short- and long-ranged, "
"but both of them take place between units in adjacent hexes. Short-range "
"combat usually involves weapons such as swords, axes or fangs, while long-"
"range combat usually involves weapons such as bows, spears and fireballs. "
"Combat is relatively straightforward; the attacker and defender alternate "
"attacks until each has used their allotted number of attacks.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Order and number of attacks'</header>\n"
"\n"
"The attacker gets the first attack, then the defender. This continues to "
"alternate until each unit has used up all of its attacks. The number of "
"attacks a unit gets varies; for instance, an Elvish fighter with a 5-4 sword "
"attack may make 4 swings each dealing 5 damage, while an Orcish Grunt with 9-"
"2 only gets 2 swings (but at 9 damage).\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Chance to hit'</header>\n"
"\n"
"With two exceptions, the chance to hit a unit is based solely on its defense "
"rating in the <ref>dst=terrain text=Terrain</ref> it is currently standing "
"in. This may be found by right-clicking a unit, selecting Unit Description, "
"and then clicking <italic>text='Terrain Modifiers'</italic>. For instance, "
"elves have a defense rating of 70% in forest, meaning a unit attacking them "
"has only a 30% chance of hitting them. Conversely, the elf's chance of "
"hitting the attacker in return depends on what terrain the attacker is in.\n"
"There are two exceptions to this rule: <ref>dst=magical_attacks "
"text='Magical attacks'</ref> and <ref>dst=ability_marksman text=Marksmen</"
"ref>. Magical attacks always have a 70% chance to hit, regardless of "
"terrain, and Marksmen always have at least a 60% chance to hit, regardless "
"of terrain.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text=Damage</header>\n"
"\n"
"Each blow which hits causes a base amount of damage depending on the attack "
"type. For instance, an Elvish Fighter with a 5-4 sword attack causes a base "
"of 5 damage. This is usually modified by two things: "
"<ref>dst=damage_type_and_resistance text=Resistance</ref> and "
"<ref>dst=time_of_day text='Time of Day'</ref>, both of which are explained "
"below.\n"
"\n"

"In Wesnoth, there are three types of damage usually associated with physical "

"further types of damage usually associated with magical attacks: Fire, Cold "
"and Holy attacks. Different units may have resistances which alter the "
"damage which they take from certain damage types.\n"
"\n"
"Resistances work very simply: If a unit has 40% resistance against a damage "
"type, then they will suffer 40% less damage when hit with that damage type. "
"It is also possible for a unit to have weakness; if a unit has -100% "
"resistance against a damage type, it will suffer 100% more damage when hit "

"In Wesnoth, it is not enough simply to recruit units and fight. You must "
"watch your gold as well, especially in campaigns, where you can carry extra "
"gold over from one scenario to the next. There are two aspects to this; "
"Income and Upkeep.\n"
"\n"
"Income is simple. For every village you control, you gain one gold a turn. "
"Thus, if you have ten villages, you would normally gain ten gold. "
"Unfortunately, your Upkeep costs are subtracted from this income, as "
"detailed below.\n"
"\n"
"Upkeep is also fairly simple. Each unit requires an amount of Upkeep equal "
"to its level. You can support as many levels <italic>text=worth</italic> of "
"units as you have villages for free. However, for each level of unit beyond "
"the number of villages you have, you must pay one gold per turn. For "
"example, if you have twelve level one units and ten villages, you would have "
"to pay two gold a turn in upkeep.\n"
"\n"
"These costs are subtracted from your Income, so in the case of twelve levels "
"of units and ten villages, your resultant Income would be 8 gold a turn.\n"
"There are two main exceptions to Upkeep. Firstly, units with the Loyal trait "
"will only ever count as level one for upkeep purposes, regardless of their "
"actual level. Secondly, units you begin the scenario with (such as Konrad or "
"Delfador), or units who join you during a scenario (such as the Horseman in "
"the second level of Heir to the Throne) will never charge any upkeep."

"Most units have two traits. Traits are attributes of the unit that modify "

"\n"
"The currently available traits are the following.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"<header>text=Intelligent</header>\n"
"\n"
"Intelligent units require 20% less experience than usual to advance.\n"
"\n"
"Intelligent units are very useful at the beginning of a campaign, as they "
"can be quickly advanced into much needed higher level units. Later in the "
"campaign, they are not quite so useful, and if you have plenty of high level "
"units you may find yourself recalling units with more useful ''long-term'' "
"traits.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"<header>text=Loyal</header>\n"
"\n"
"Loyal units only ever require an upkeep of one, no matter what level they "
"are.\n"
"\n"
"Loyal has no affect on a level one unit, which makes it useless in the early "
"campaign. Once a unit begins to level up, however, it can save you "
"considerable gold over the course of the campaign.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"<header>text=Quick</header>\n"
"\n"
"Quick units have 1 extra movement point, but 10% less HP than usual.\n"
"\n"
"Quick is the most noticeable trait, particularly in slower units such as "
"trolls or heavy infantry. Units with the Quick trait can often have greatly "
"increased mobility in rough terrain, so consider that when deploying your "
"forces. Also, remember that Quick units aren't quite as tough as usual, and "
"so aren't so good for holding positions.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"<header>text=Resilient</header>\n"
"\n"
"Resilient units have 7 more HP than usual.\n"
"\n"
"Resilient units can be useful at all stages in the campaign, and is a useful "
"trait for all units, though you'll find yourself noticing it more in some "
"units than others. Resilient units are especially useful for holding ground "
"against opponents.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"<header>text=Strong</header>\n"
"\n"
"Strong units do 1 more damage per swing in melee combat, and have 2 more "
"HP.\n"
"\n"
"Useful for any close-combat unit, Strong is most effective for units who "
"have a high number of swings, such as the Elvish Fighter. Strong units can "
"be very useful when a tiny bit of extra damage is all that is needed to turn "
"a damaging stroke into a killing blow. "

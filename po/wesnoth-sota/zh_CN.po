"My experiments with bats have proven unfruitful. I have determined that they "

"Today, headmaster Aimucasur himself taught a class on moving objects with "
"one’s mind. The technique involves projecting one’s will inside the item, "
"and then learning to move it as an extension of the body. Incantations focus "
"the mind to the task. We practiced with inanimate objects, but clearly the "
"same principle could be applied to unliving flesh. Nobody dared voice the "
"thought, because showing interest in the necromantic arts results in "

"One of my bats must have been old, for it died. Boldly then, I decided to "
"animate the corpse. I was pleased to see that it worked, but what was "
"interesting was this: The first time the bat twitched, I felt a last spark "
"of life energy flash through its body. I noted that it flowed through some "
"kind of pathway. That gave me an idea. With my mind, I searched out all the "
"life force pathways in its body using what I could sense in the living bats "
"as a guide. Then I animated <i>them</i> all at once, and the bat slowly "
"flapped off the floor on its own! (That is a trick old Aimucasur probably "
"doesn’t know!) Even better, the energy running through the life force "
"network seemed to maintain itself, so I didn’t need to continue to "
"concentrate. Could this be the whole secret? Could all the ancient lords "
"have had someone bring them back <i>after</i> death? I would need another "

"了，我很高兴，但更有趣的是这个：蝙蝠第一次抽搐时，我感到它最后的生命能量在它"
"体内一闪而过。我发现这能量流过了某种通路。这让我有了个点子。通过我的心智，以"
"我能在活体蝙蝠体内感知到的生命力通路为指导，我找出了尸体上的全部通路。而后，"
"我一下子把<b>它们</b>都激活了，而蝙蝠靠着自己的力量，慢慢拍起翅膀飞离了地板！"
"（那可能是老艾谬卡瑟也不知道的技巧啊！）更妙的是，在生命力网络里游走的能量似"
"乎能够自给自足，所以我不必继续全神贯注。这会不会就是死灵术的全部秘密？上古的"

"With further observation, I have determined that this is probably not the "
"way to avoid death. The reanimated bat has no will! It does nothing unless I "
"nudge it with my mind. Perhaps the will of a human is stronger, and someday "
"soon I will have the opportunity to find out... because I’m quitting the "
"Academy. I will be in my room when old Morvihn checks for the night, but not "
"two hours later! I grow weary of this place and its restrictions on thought. "
"So, no more brown initiate’s robes, no more being ridiculed on account of my "
"hair, no more pompous instructors. I will teach myself the so-called “dark” "
"arts and learn how to live forever! The ancients from the Green Isle found a "
"way, so I can discover it too. When all these oldsters here find themselves "

"来确定这一点了……因为我要从学院退学了。老莫维恩查寝时我还会在房间里，但两小时"
"之后就不会了！我对这地方和它对思想的钳制厌倦了。所以，不会再有什么新生的褐色"
"袍子了，不会再有什么对我头发的嘲笑了，不会再有什么自大的讲师了。我会自学所谓"
"的“黑暗”法术，并学会如何永生！绿岛的上古领主们发现了永生的方法，所有我也能发"

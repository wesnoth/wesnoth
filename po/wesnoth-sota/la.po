"live far longer. Though this may be the natural order, we need not embrace "
"it! The lords on the Green Isle knew how to live forever. Pursuit of that "
"knowledge was declared illegal by King Haldric I, but I believe it is worth "
"the risk. As I watched my family waste away of various maladies, I vowed "
"that I would not share their fate, and if I can rediscover the secrets of "
"the ancients I will be a hero to the whole continent! I shall begin research "
"in earnest this winter."

"My experiments with bats have proven unfruitful. I have determined that they "

"has fed. There is nothing I can learn from bats about extending life. Now I "
"have a problem. I am forced to keep the bats and pretend they are my pets "
"because I cannot admit why I was studying them. In truth, it is not a burden "
"— I have grown somewhat fond of the creatures, and I don’t mind appearing "

"One of my bats must have been old, for it died. Boldly then, I decided to "
"animate the corpse. I was pleased to see that it worked, but what was "
"interesting was this: The first time the bat twitched, I felt a last spark "
"of life energy flash through its body. I noted that it flowed through some "
"kind of pathway. That gave me an idea. With my mind, I searched out all the "
"life force pathways in its body using what I could sense in the living bats "
"as a guide. Then I animated <i>them</i> all at once, and the bat slowly "
"flapped off the floor on its own! (That is a trick old Aimucasur probably "
"doesn’t know!) Even better, the energy running through the life force "
"network seemed to maintain itself, so I didn’t need to continue to "
"concentrate. Could this be the whole secret? Could all the ancient lords "
"have had someone bring them back <i>after</i> death? I would need another "
"mage I trusted completely, but perhaps I can find someone with whom to make "
"a pact."

"With further observation, I have determined that this is probably not the "
"way to avoid death. The reanimated bat has no will! It does nothing unless I "
"nudge it with my mind. Perhaps the will of a human is stronger, and someday "
"soon I will have the opportunity to find out... because I’m quitting the "
"Academy. I will be in my room when old Morvihn checks for the night, but not "
"two hours later! I grow weary of this place and its restrictions on thought. "
"So, no more brown initiate’s robes, no more being ridiculed on account of my "
"hair, no more pompous instructors. I will teach myself the so-called “dark” "
"arts and learn how to live forever! The ancients from the Green Isle found a "
"way, so I can discover it too. When all these oldsters here find themselves "
"breathing their last, they will have to beg me for the secret. Perhaps I "

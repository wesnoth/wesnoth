"My experiments with bats have proven unfruitful. I have determined that they "

"has fed. There is nothing I can learn from bats about extending life. Now I "

"Today, headmaster Aimucasur himself taught a class on moving objects with "

"One of my bats must have been old, for it died. Boldly then, I decided to "
"animate the corpse. I was pleased to see that it worked, but what was "
"interesting was this: The first time the bat twitched, I felt a last spark "
"of life energy flash through its body. I noted that it flowed through some "
"kind of pathway. That gave me an idea. With my mind, I searched out all the "
"life force pathways in its body using what I could sense in the living bats "
"as a guide. Then I animated <i>them</i> all at once, and the bat slowly "
"flapped off the floor on its own! (That is a trick old Aimucasur probably "
"doesn’t know!) Even better, the energy running through the life force "
"network seemed to maintain itself, so I didn’t need to continue to "

"能量離開了牠的身體。我注意到，這股流動有特定的路徑。這，給了我一個想法。透過"

"soon I will have the opportunity to find out... because I’m quitting the "

"two hours later! I grow weary of this place and its restrictions on thought. "

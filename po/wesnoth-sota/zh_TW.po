"My experiments with bats have proven unfruitful. I have determined that they "
"do not truly drain the life force of their victims — it is an illusion. The "
"loss of blood weakens the victim, while the bat gains vitality because it "
"has fed. There is nothing I can learn from bats about extending life. Now I "
"have a problem. I am forced to keep the bats and pretend they are my pets "

"我無法蝙蝠身上學到什麼。現在，我有個麻煩。我被迫養著這些蝙蝠，假裝牠們是我的"

"Today, headmaster Aimucasur himself taught a class on moving objects with "

"One of my bats must have been old, for it died. Boldly then, I decided to "
"animate the corpse. I was pleased to see that it worked, but what was "
"interesting was this: The first time the bat twitched, I felt a last spark "
"of life energy flash through its body. I noted that it flowed through some "
"kind of pathway. That gave me an idea. With my mind, I searched out all the "
"life force pathways in its body using what I could sense in the living bats "
"as a guide. Then I animated <i>them</i> all at once, and the bat slowly "
"flapped off the floor on its own! (That is a trick old Aimucasur probably "
"doesn’t know!) Even better, the energy running through the life force "
"network seemed to maintain itself, so I didn’t need to continue to "
"concentrate. Could this be the whole secret? Could all the ancient lords "
"have had someone bring them back <i>after</i> death? I would need another "

"我其中一隻蝙蝠看來是太老了，因為牠今天死了。我大膽的將意志投射到牠的屍體。我"
"很高興這有用，而且還發現件有趣的事：當第一次蝙蝠抽搐時，我感應到最後一絲生命"
"能量離開了牠的身體。我注意到，這股流動有特定的路徑。這，給了我一個想法。透過"
"我的意志，我從活著的蝙蝠中找出一切我能找到的生命力流動路徑。接著，我讓<i>它們"
"</i>全都活了過來，這些蝙蝠慢慢自力從地板上拍動翅膀！（這招老阿米卡瑟八成不知"
"道！）更好的是，通過生命力網路的能量可以獨立維持，所以我不用持續專注。這是全"

"With further observation, I have determined that this is probably not the "
"way to avoid death. The reanimated bat has no will! It does nothing unless I "
"nudge it with my mind. Perhaps the will of a human is stronger, and someday "
"soon I will have the opportunity to find out... because I’m quitting the "
"Academy. I will be in my room when old Morvihn checks for the night, but not "
"two hours later! I grow weary of this place and its restrictions on thought. "
"So, no more brown initiate’s robes, no more being ridiculed on account of my "
"hair, no more pompous instructors. I will teach myself the so-called “dark” "
"arts and learn how to live forever! The ancients from the Green Isle found a "

"一天我會找出辦法...因為我正要離開學院。在老莫威恩查房時我會待在房間，但兩小時"
"後就不是了！因為我對這邊的想法設限感到厭煩。所以我不再會穿著這棕色的學徒長"
"袍，沒人會再因我的髮而嘲笑我，也不再有傲慢的導師。我會去自學那所謂的「黑暗」"
"魔法，並去學習如何永生！綠島的古人曾發現方法，而我會追隨他們的腳步。當這邊的"

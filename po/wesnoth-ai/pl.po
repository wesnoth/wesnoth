"<u>General</u>: These AIs are set up to simulate (to some extent) how these "
"animals behave in real life. This includes that they are animals, meaning "
"that they are not super smart. As an example, the wolves generally hunt in a "
"pack, but are easily distracted by prey coming into range. They are also "
"decent, but not great at cornering deer. For the most part, this is "
"intentional.\n"
"\n"
"<u>Bears (replaced by Ghasts), Spiders and Yetis</u> mostly just wander in "
"their respective parts of the map. They stay out of each other's way (and "
"out of the way of the dogs), but do attack each other if cornered. They "
"attack the other, weaker animals (deer etc.) if those are within range.\n"
"\n"
"<u>Wolves</u> hunt in a pack. They actively go after the closest deer (as "
"long as it stays in the forest) and try to corner it (not always super "
"successfully), but are easily distracted by other prey coming into range. "
"The wolves try to avoid getting into the range of bears, spiders, dogs and "
"the yeti, except when they are going in for an attack. If you let them move "
"for long enough, they will also learn that it is not healthy to attack the "
"tusklets. When no deer is left, they wander randomly. Note that, unlike the "
"Wolves Multipack AI (used in a different scenario), this Wolves AI combines "
"all wolves of the side in the same pack."
msgstr ""

#: data/ai/micro_ais/scenarios/animals.cfg:12
msgid ""
"Each <u>Deer (replaced by Vampire Bats)</u> wanders randomly on forest "
"tiles, except when enemies get in its (the deer's) range, in which case it "
"flees to the farthest point it can reach.\n"
"\n"
"<u>Tuskers (replaced by Ogres)</u> exhibit the same behavior as deer, except "
"when an enemy is next to one of the tusklets. This enemy will then "
"experience the full wrath of an irate boar.\n"
"\n"
"<u>Tusklets (replaced by Young Ogres)</u> blindly follow the closest adult "
"tusker, except when there is no tusker left, in which case they behave the "
"same as deer.\n"
"\n"
"<u>Rabbits (replaced by Rats)</u> also wander randomly, but in addition "
"disappear into their holes (replaced by straw bales; if any are within "
"reach) when enemies are close. They reappear out of their holes at the "
"beginning of the turn, if it is safe.\n"
"\n"
"<u>Sheep dogs (replaced by Footpads)</u> try to keep their sheep safe. This "
"involves keeping them inside the area outlined by the path the dogs have "
"worn into the meadow, positioning themselves in between the sheep and "
"approaching enemies, and attacking the enemies if those get too close. You "
"might have to let the scenario play for quite some time before you get to "
"see an interesting dog/wolf interaction. If no active herding or protecting "
"move is needed, the dogs go to a random location on the path.\n"
"\n"
"<u>Sheep (replaced by Troll Whelps)</u> wander aimlessly except when a sheep "
"dog is next to them, in which case they run away from the dog. The dogs "
"exploit this by positioning themselves on the outside of the sheep, if "
"possible. Sheep also run away from approaching enemies. The sheep, dogs and "
"forest creatures (deer, tuskers, rabbits) have learned that they are no "
"threat to each other and leave each other alone, demonstrating the enormous "
"self control of a well trained sheep dog."

"its own health) attacks any enemy units that come into range, as long as "
"that does not mean separating the pack by more than a few hexes. Staying "

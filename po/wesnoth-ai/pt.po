msgid   "<u>General</u>: These AIs are set up to simulate (to some extent) how "
        "these animals behave in real life. This includes that they are "
        "animals, meaning that they are not super smart. As an example, the "
        "wolves generally hunt in a pack, but are easily distracted by prey "
        "coming into range. They are also decent, but not great at cornering "
        "deer. For the most part, this is intentional.\n"
        "\n"
        "<u>Bears (replaced by Ghasts), Spiders and Yetis</u> mostly just "
        "wander in their respective parts of the map. They stay out of each "
        "other's way (and out of the way of the dogs), but do attack each "
        "other if cornered. They attack the other, weaker animals (deer etc.) "
        "if those are within range.\n"
        "\n"
        "<u>Wolves</u> hunt in a pack. They actively go after the closest deer "
        "(as long as it stays in the forest) and try to corner it (not always "
        "super successfully), but are easily distracted by other prey coming "
        "into range. The wolves try to avoid getting into the range of bears, "
        "spiders, dogs and the yeti, except when they are going in for an "
        "attack. If you let them move for long enough, they will also learn "
        "that it is not healthy to attack the tusklets. When no deer is left, "
        "they wander randomly. Note that, unlike the Wolves Multipack AI (used "
        "in a different scenario), this Wolves AI combines all wolves of the "
        "side in the same pack."

msgid   "Each <u>Deer (replaced by Vampire Bats)</u> wanders randomly on "
        "forest tiles, except when enemies get in its (the deer's) range, in "
        "which case it flees to the farthest point it can reach.\n"
        "\n"
        "<u>Tuskers (replaced by Ogres)</u> exhibit the same behavior as deer, "
        "except when an enemy is next to one of the tusklets. This enemy will "

        "\n"

        "the dogs have worn into the meadow, positioning themselves in between "
        "the sheep and approaching enemies, and attacking the enemies if those "
        "get too close. You might have to let the scenario play for quite some "
        "time before you get to see an interesting dog/wolf interaction. If no "
        "active herding or protecting move is needed, the dogs go to a random "

        "of the sheep, if possible. Sheep also run away from approaching "
        "enemies. The sheep, dogs and forest creatures (deer, tuskers, "
        "rabbits) have learned that they are no threat to each other and leave "
        "each other alone, demonstrating the enormous self control of a well "

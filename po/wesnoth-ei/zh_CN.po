#. If the player accepts the plague staff, the unit that picks it up can recruit walking corpses of animals (but not humans),
#. randomly getting a falcon, spider, wolf or sand scorpion corpse. Here “crown” means “top of head”, or “top of cephalothorax”.
#. Dacyn says this the first time a corpse is recruited, and this event could happen in almost any scenario from S07b onwards.
#. Even before picking up the amulet, he’s showing a level of interest that might get a student expelled from the Academy on Alduin

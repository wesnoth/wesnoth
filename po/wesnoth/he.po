"The many paths that a mage can take in study lead to strikingly different "

"bind reality together, and have managed, somewhat, to unravel the mysteries "
"of a world far more vast than most would ever imagine. Often viewed as "

"which often employ them in the field, they remain somewhat aloof.\n"
"\n"
"They have, in fact, their own order amongst the ranks of magi, an order "
"which withholds certain secrets from their peers. One of these is an "
"apparent ability to cross great distances, faster than one could possibly "
"travel on foot. Members of the silver order ardently refuse to discuss the "
"workings of this with any of their fellow magi, and on those rare occasions "
"when others have pried into their work, they have abandoned the endeavor, "
"never to speak of it again.\n"
"\n"
"Silver magi are often more physically adept than other magi, and their "
"skills are of undeniable use on the battlefield, if one can manage to coerce "
"the mage into applying them.\n"

"Special Notes: the ranged attack of a silver mage is magical, and always has "
"a high chance of hitting an opponent. Silver Magi are highly resistant to "
"many forms of magical damage. They can also teleport between any two "

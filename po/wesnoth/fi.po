"Battle for Wesnoth is a turn-based fantasy strategy game somewhat unusual "
"amongst modern strategy games. While other games strive for complexity, both "
"in rules and gameplay, Battle for Wesnoth strives for simplicity of rules "
"and gameplay. This does not make the game simple, however - from these "
"simple rules arise a wealth of strategy, making the game easy to learn but a "
"challenge to master."

"Battle for Wesnoth on vuoropohjainen fantasiastrategiapeli, joka on hieman "
"muista moderneista strategiapeleistä poikkeava. Siinä missä muut pelit "

"pelaamisen osalta, Battle for Wesnoth pyrkii sääntöjen ja pelattavuuden "

"yksinkertainen; näistä yksinkertaisista säännöistä saadaan kasaan "
"monenlaisia strategioita, joten peli on helppo oppia, mutta vaikea hallita."

"A halberd is a difficult and very heavy weapon to use, but powerful in the "
"hands of an expert. It is also much more flexible than the spear from which "
"it descended. As any halberdier can tell you, the weapon possesses 4 primary "
"striking points, 2 more than a spear or pike; these are the tip, the blade, "
"the spike at the base of the shaft, and the inner point on the blade, which "
"can be used in a motion pulling back towards the wielder. All this makes for "
"a very versatile weapon in melee, especially against cavalry.\n"
"\n"
"However, a halberd is notably more expensive to craft than a spear, and in "
"the hands of a novice, much less effective. In the armies of Wesnoth, it is "
"customary only to grant these weapons to veteran pikemen, who have proven "
"that they have the skill to employ them properly on the field of war.\n"

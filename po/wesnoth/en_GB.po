"Drakes are large, winged and fire-breathing creatures, reminiscent of true "
"dragons. On average, an adult drake stands around three meters tall and "
"easily weighs more than a man and a horse combined. Their skin is made up of "
"hard scales, resistant to most physical strikes except piercing and cold "
"damage. Most drakes are capable of true flight and can travel long distances "
"quickly. However, their sheer weight and bulk does limit their flight "
"ability somewhat, making them ungainly in the air. Where possible, they make "
"use of terrain features such as hills, mountains and trees as springboards "
"in order to gain greater height and speed. Fortunately for their enemies, "
"they are still quite clumsy creatures and surprisingly slow in combat. This, "
"combined with their large size, renders them easy targets for those who dare "
"attack them.\n"
"\n"
"Drakes are inherently magical creatures, with a mysterious internal fire "
"fueling their very lives. This can easily be witnessed when one of their "
"kind perishes in combat; its internal fire is released, burning their "
"remains in to ashes. Their internal fire is also their greatest weakness; it "
"makes them vulnerable extremely vulnerable to cold attacks. Despite their "
"magical nature, drakes are incapable of channeling magic in a controlled "
"manner. While the magic imbued within a drake's body enables it to spit fire "
"and gives it life, they have no willful control over its functions of this "
"magic.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Society'</header>\n"
"While Drakes seem to be a relatively warlike race, and their societies can "
"be best described as a cultured martial society. A small group of veteran "
"warriors headed by a mutually respected - or simply feared - leader rules "
"the society with an iron fist. Every drake is expected to earn their place "
"in the strict hierarchy, to obey their superiors and command their lessers. "
"Entry to the highest ruling classes practically only happens through "
"challenging and defeating a superior in single combat, which is the way the "
"hierarchy inside the ruling class itself is established. The use of "
"deception of any kind towards any fellow drake is, without exception, seen "
"as cowardly and unacceptable.\n"
"\n"
"While their warlike nature and sense of territory drive them to defend their "
"own territories savagely, drakes rarely invade or trespass on areas already "
"occupied of the other major races. Instead, they most commonly settle in "
"unpopulated areas to establish their own territory there. They primarily "
"feed on large game they hunt in the lowlands around their homes, but "
"hatchlings and lower caste drakes are known to feed also on certain of moss "
"and fungi they cultivate deep in their cavers. The only technology drakes "
"value is armour- and weapon-smithing, and know or need little else in terms "
"of science and culture besides this to survive and thrive. However the few "
"implements they do fashion are almost unrivaled in quality, only matched by "
"those produced in the finest Dwarven foundries.\n"
"\n"
"Drakes are hatched from eggs and usually live naturally between 20 to 30 "
"years. Death in battle is the most preferred way for a drake to leave this "
"world, and unlike the old members of other races, drakes naturally grow more "
"aggressive and reckless towards the ends of their natural lives, perhaps to "
"help ensure their place in the heroic legends of their kind.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Geography'</header>\n"
"Drakes originate from the island of Morogor in the Great Ocean. However, "
"since the island has been slowly sinking for centuries, and colonies of "
"drakes have slowly spread to the Great Continent. Drakes tend make their "
"homes in mountain caverns near volcanoes to protect their eggs, hatchings "
"and forges. While drakes naturally prefer warmth, their internal fire is "
"more than capable of sustaining them even in a relatively cold climate, a "
"feature which has allowed them to populate even some of the mountains of the "
"far north of the Great Continent."

"The dwarves are a race famed for their miners, blacksmiths, merchants and "
"warriors. Considered as the third oldest race on the great continent after "
"the elves and trolls, their early history is shrouded in mystery. Legends "
"tell of a time long forgotten when their people began emerging from their "
"underground world through caves. Nothing is known about their life prior to "
"their arrival, or their reasons for entering the surface world, but they "
"have been an integral part of the continent’s history since. Soon after "
"their emergence from the underground, the dwarves entered into conflict with "
"the original inhabitants of the land, the elves. The original reason for "
"their dispute has been lost to history, but the two races have since fought "
"three long wars, interrupted by a few decades of peace. During these wars "
"the dwarves could not dislodge the elves from the deep forests in the south, "
"but managed to consolidate their position in hills and the mountains in the "
"north of the continent, known now as the Northlands. Since then they have "
"constructed fantastic fortifications and settlements deep within the "
"mountains and crags of their territory.\n"
"\n"
"Possibly due to their isolation, the dwarves are generally distrustful or "
"hostile towards most other races, particularly the elves. The single "
"exception to this temperament is towards humans. This could be traced back "
"to the era of Haldric I and the arrival of humans and orcs to the content. "
"At this point the dwarves started allowing some humans, mostly dissidents "
"and outlaws from the Crown of Wesnoth, to settle in certain areas of the "
"Northlands. Their motivation was unsurprising. The plight of these "
"individuals reminded the dwarves of their early history of persecution, "
"eliciting a sense of solidarity. The dwarves also had much to gain in "
"forming a bond with these outcasts. They would settle in areas where dwarves "
"disliked living themselves; plains, forests, and swamps, freeing them from "
"defending these areas. Later, when threatened by the Orcs, the dwarves and "
"their human allies formed The Alliance of Knalga to defend their common "
"realm.\n"
"\n"
"Dwarves are slight creatures, but they are by no means fragile. Their "
"warriors, tough and powerful are both feared and respected throughout the "
"continent for their prowess in battle. In addition dwarves are known for "
"their calculating intellect and superb craftsmanship. Dwarven smiths are "
"renowned for their deadly weapons and heavy armor, which clad their stout "
"warriors. These accruements are unrivaled in quality, possibly only matched "
"by those produced by drake armourers. Their intelligence and natural "
"inquisitiveness has also made them the most technically advanced race on the "
"continent. One of their most famous, and feared, discoveries was a "
"mysterious powder that produces an immense explosion when exposed to fire or "
"sparks. Certain dwarf warriors use this powder to hurl small objects at "
"tremendous speeds. Given their technological inclinations, many dwarves tend "
"to distrust magic users. However a small group does practice a form of magic "
"based on the engraving of runes. Called runesmiths, they use these carvings "
"to enchant items in order to augment certain aspects of its nature,  but "
"were rumored to have been wiped out in a tragic accident several centuries "
"ago. Since the art’s rediscovery, it has gained greater acceptance among "
"many dwarves, but many still treat the runesmiths’ craft with disdain."

"Compared to humans, elves are somewhat taller, more agile but less sturdy. "
"They have slightly pointy ears, pale skin and usually blond hair. Though few "

"unusually long life - most, unless claimed by illness, accident or war, live "
"a two full centuries. While some elves possessing a high magical aptitude "
"have been known to live an additional full century, most elves begin to grow "
"physically frail approaching their twentieth decade and pass away within a "

"most of their kin are unable to channel it directly, its latent presence "
"gives them their keen senses and long life. It many cases it manifests at "
"will, allowing them to achieve tasks that most normal beings would find "
"astonishing. Those elves that learn to actually wield this power can become "
"truly formidable in it's use. Many chose to use their gift to heal others.\n"
"\n"
"Due to their long life, elves are not driven by a primal lust of life to the "
"extent that shorter living races like humans or orcs are. Instead, elves "
"spend much of their time engaging in individualistic pursuits. Those not "
"adept at the magical arts typically devote their time honing their physical "
"skills. As a result, elves excel at archery, which is perhaps their most "
"important method of warfare. Most elvish troops carry a bow and no other "
"race can rival their archers in speed and accuracy. All elves also share a "
"mysterious, natural affection to unspoiled nature, which they cannot quite "
"explain. They often feel uncomfortable in open unvegetated spaces and "
"leading them to make their homes in the forests around Great Continent, such "
"as Aethenwood in the southwest and Wesmere in the northwest. As far as one "
"can tell, no other race predates the elves on the continent, with the "
"possible exception of trolls. Many of their settlements cannot be reliably "
"dated, undoubtedly existing over a millennium."

"Almost every orc are a member of a tribe or a clan. Relations between "

"animosity. In addition, a single strong chieftain may emerge to lead "

"blood - although it's most commonly used to trade insults or threats between "
"tribal leaders.\n"
"\n"
"Orc societies are based on little else but strength; might makes right, and "
"a leader leads and survives only as long as no one manages to wrest the "

"position - although history knows some notable exceptions. Orcs hold no "
"particular honour code and while undisputable raw strength is usually the "
"preferred method of displaying power, assassination, poisoning and "
"backstabbing are completely viable means to further one's own goals.\n"
"\n"
"Orcs mostly live in rural areas, often in foothills or mountainous regions, "
"sometimes in caves. They grow no crops nor keep livestock, but are competent "
"hunters as a result of their physical stature and brutality. Due to their "
"large numbers they are capable of hunting an area virtually clean of "
"anything larger than rodents in relatively short period of time. Due to this "
"and their unstable leadership, orcish tribes tend to lead a semi-nomadic "
"lifestyle, never settling in one region for too long. The larger tribes may "
"establish themselves firmly in an area for years or even decades and build "
"large encampments almost resembling cities, but even these are easily "
"dismantled and abandoned if there is a need to relocate the horde.\n"
"\n"
"The oldest known orcs have been around 50 to 60 years of age, but very few "
"individuals ever live to see over two or three decades before meeting their "
"end either in war or by the hand of one of their kin. The oldest orcs are "
"often shamans, which are perhaps the only ones most of their kind sees as "
"being trustworthy and neutral. The origins for this custom are unknown, as "
"the shamans do not directly contribute much to orcish societies but only act "
"as advisors, which is not something orcs tend to otherwise tolerate. Shamans "
"are in many ways the opposite of almost every other orc: they are often "
"physically withered and frail in comparison and lack skill in battle. "
"Despite their reliance on raw strength, not nearly all orcs are destined to "
"grow to possess any. Many orcs are born smaller and weaker than the rest, "
"and already almost as newborns are put in their place by their stronger "
"siblings. The stronger ones will routinely grab most of the food and thus "
"grow stronger still, while their weaker siblings do not. Many of these "

"such. Almost any dead creature can, by a sufficiently skilled necromancer, "
"be reanimated and rise again in undeath. Undead are for the most part "
"unnatural but mindless constructs, obeying whoever created them without "
"question nor thought. A greater mystery of necromancy is in how constructs "
"are sustained without continuous effort from the necromancer. An undead "
"creature requires not the constant attention of the necromancer to command "
"and sustain, but can work autonomously according to the commands of it's "
"master. Only rarely, perhaps once every few months, does the necromancer "
"need to maintain his creation.\n"
"\n"
"Necromancy is almost solely limited to humans. Even the legends of magically "
"apt races like elves and mermen tell of very few of their kind who have ever "
"delved in the dark arts. It is surmised that necromantic magic requires "
"great adaptability and a flexible mind, extremes of which are most commonly "
"found in humans.The ultimate goal of most necromancers is to turn the same "
"art of preserving and imbuing life upon themselves, to alter themselves at "
"whatever cost, to ultimately escape death by preserving their own mind and "
"spirit.\n"

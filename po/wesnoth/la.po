"Given the monstrous strength of their race, trolls can turn rather mundane "
"implements into weapons of deadly force. Some trolls piece together crude "
"slings, little different from what a child would use, save for the fact they "
"hurl boulders instead of pebbles. Though not especially accurate, a rock "
"thrown by one of these monsters can cripple a man if it hits him. Despite "
"being burdened by their heavy ammunition, and lacking in any sort of melee "
"weaponry, a troll rocklobber is still bigger, stronger, and perhaps even "
"uglier than the whelp it once was, and a troll's fist serves as well as a "
"man's hammer in combat. Furthermore, their ability to strike back at an "
"enemy archer makes fighting them a dicey proposition at any range, unless "
"one can attack under heavy cover of terrain.\n"
"\n"
"Usage:\n"
"Troll Rocklobbers fight well on rough, rocky terrain, especially at night. "
"Unlike most others of their race, a Troll Rocklobber will make many archers "
"think twice about attacking, and is quite dangerous for an enemy spellcaster "
"to attack. They are quite powerful against brittle foes, like skeletons, and "
"quite weak against well armored or naturally resilient enemies, such as "
"their woodland counterpart, the wose. Their regeneration allows them to cure "
"poison and heal wounds without the aid of a nearby village. Their relatively "
"slow speed is a liability, as is their weakness during daylight hours. The "
"greatest danger to a Troll Rocklobber is a powerful melee unit attacking "
"them in open terrain during the day, when they are weakest."

"A terrifying, monstrous bastion of strength, a Troll Warrior brings to fore "
"all the tales that have been told of their race's terrifying power. Wielding "
"massive hammers that could knock a house off its foundation, and able to "
"absorb a seemingly endless rash of punishment, Troll Warriors are capable of "
"singlehandedly changing the strategies of an enemy commander they face. A "
"troll warrior is not something brought down by one man, but by a whole group "
"of them, fighting desperately against this hideous strength borne before "
"them. That which causes the most terror about a troll warrior, is not their "
"appearance, or their power, but the fact that one brought even within an "

"sent to death.\n"
"\n"
"Usage:\n"
"Troll Warriors fight well on rough, rocky terrain, especially at night. "
"Though vulnerable to archers and spellcasters, especially in open terrain, "

"brought down by several enemies. There are few enemies which can engage them "
"in one-on-one combat without a great danger of being killed on the same "

"however, a Troll 'whelp' already possesses the terrifying strength native to "

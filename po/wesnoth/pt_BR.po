"Battle for Wesnoth is a turn-based fantasy strategy game somewhat unusual "
"among modern strategy games. While other games strive for complexity, both "
"in rules and gameplay, Battle for Wesnoth strives for simplicity of rules "

"elementos. Isso, porém, não deixa o jogo em si simples - pois dessas simples "

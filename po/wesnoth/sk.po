#~ "\n"
#~ "Príjmy sú jednoduché. Za každú dedinu, ktorú máš pod kontrolou, dostaneš "

#~ "vysvetlím nižšie.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Výdavky sú tiež pomerne jednoduché. Každá jednotka si vyžaduje žold vo "
#~ "výške svojej úrovne. Zadarmo dokážeš vyplatiť jednotky s "
#~ "<italic>text='toľkými úrovňami'</italic>, koľko máš dedín. Za každú "
#~ "úroveň jednotky prevyšujúcu počet tvojich dedín musíš zaplatiť jednu "

#~ "s dvanástimi úrovňami spolu a desiatich dedín by tvoj výsledný príjem "
#~ "tvoril 8 zlatých za kolo.\n"
#~ "Ohľadom žoldu sú dve dôležité výnimky. Po prvé, verné jednotky budú bez "
#~ "ohľadu na úroveň požadovať taký žold, ako keby mali úroveň 1. Po druhé, "
#~ "jednotky, ktoré máš na začiatku scény (napríklad Konrád a Delfador), "
#~ "alebo jednotky, ktoré sa k tebe počas scény pripoja (napríkad jazdec v "
#~ "druhej scéne výpravy \"Dedič trónu\") nebudú pýtať žold nikdy."

#~ "<header>text=Quick</header>\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Quick units have 1 extra movement point, but 10% less HP than usual.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Quick is the most noticeable trait, particularly in slower units such as "
#~ "trolls or heavy infantry. Units with the Quick trait can often have "
#~ "greatly increased mobility in rough terrain, so consider that when "
#~ "deploying your forces. Also, remember that Quick units aren't quite as "
#~ "tough as usual, and so aren't so good for holding positions.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "<header>text=Resilient</header>\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Resilient units have 7 more HP than usual.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Resilient units can be useful at all stages in the campaign, and is a "

#~ "<header>text=Strong</header>\n"

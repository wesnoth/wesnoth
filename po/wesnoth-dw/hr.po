"In the Far North, where the Mountains of Dorth approach the coast, lies a "

"his wrath was also fearsome to behold. He readied his army to follow the "
"orcs. His stated purpose was not revenge, but the desire to secure the "
"safety of Jotha with a demonstration of force that would teach the orcs to "
"steer well clear of the merfolk. The merfolk army caught up with the orc "

"In the Far North, where the Mountains of Dorth approach the coast, lies a "

"In 626 YW, Jotha was attacked by a larger raiding party than ever before. "

"with the slain was the wife of Kai Laudiss. The kai’s grief was great, but "
"his wrath was also fearsome to behold. He readied his army to follow the "
"orcs. His stated purpose was not revenge, but the desire to secure the "
"safety of Jotha with a demonstration of force that would teach the orcs to "
"steer well clear of the merfolk. The merfolk army caught up with the orc "

"the orcs would not soon forget; but the cost was heavy. Kai Laudiss was "
"felled by a poisoned orcish dart, and the greater part of his army was "
"destroyed. When the remaining soldiers returned to Jotha, Krellis, the young "

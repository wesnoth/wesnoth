#. "Faerie" in this paragraph is a rare, poetic word in
#. English. It is the proper name of a magical otherworld
#. associated with elves - actually, originally with
#. fairies, but before Tolkien the boundary between elves
#. and fairies was extremely blurry. In Wesnoth it is
#. deliberately unclear whether Faerie is a place that is
#. the source of magical power or a label for the inner
#. nonhuman/magical nature of the Elves. Translate freely.

"Erlornas closed his eyes and brought his hands forward, joined palms forming "
"a cup open to the sky. Soon they began to glow, then to flare like a brazier "
"with the fire of Faerie, casting a cold, blue light all around the elf-lord. "
"A wisp of light emerged from the eerie flames, and at a few murmured words "
"from the elf-lord flew away towards the tower below. Then the light around "
"Erlornas faded and all was seemingly as before."

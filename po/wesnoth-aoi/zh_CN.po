#. "Faerie" in this paragraph is a rare, poetic word in
#. English. It is the proper name of a magical otherworld
#. associated with elves - actually, originally with
#. fairies, but before Tolkien the boundary between elves
#. and fairies was extremely blurry. In Wesnoth it is
#. deliberately unclear whether Faerie is a place that is
#. the source of magical power or a label for the inner
#. nonhuman/magical nature of the Elves. Translate freely.

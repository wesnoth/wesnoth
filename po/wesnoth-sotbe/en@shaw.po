"The peace treaty still held however, partially because the treaty — although "
"arranged by the Northern Alliance — was between the local earls and the "
"orcish tribes and didn’t have any direct connection with the Northern "
"Alliance. The other — and perhaps the main — reason why the treaty held was "

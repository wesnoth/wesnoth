"Almost home now. The last week has been full of mixed feelings for me — "
"blissful and difficult by turns. It was wonderful to be out of that dungeon "
"cell and in the sunlight again without the threat of death or worse hanging "
"over my head... but with that behind me, I turned to the almost equally "
"daunting task of making amends with my brother.\n"
"\n"
"Arvith had largely forgiven me by the time he freed me from my cell. All the "
"same, it has taken all of the past week for us to rebuild the sense of "
"comfort in each other we once had. It is fortunate that we have been able to "
"take our time getting back — we gave the Grey Woods a wide berth, and on our "
"way around it we traveled through some truly beautiful countryside. It has "
"given us plenty of time to talk."

#~ "vzájomnej pomoci, no o svete okolo seba toho veľa nevedeli. Jedného dňa "
#~ "sa však ich pokojný svet rozsypal, keď do regiónu prišiel zlý mág a začal "
#~ "šíriť zmätok a zúfalstvo."

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Bjarn, the local mage of the village, was the man who saw best how to "
#~ "deal with this threat. He asked the help of his brother Arne, leader of a "
#~ "mercenary band of horsemen, and outfitted several of the villagers with "
#~ "gear from the armory."
#~ msgstr ""
#~ "Bjarn, miestny dedinský mág, najlepšie vedel, ako si poradiť s touto "
#~ "hrozbou. Požiadal o pomoc svojho brata Arneho, veliteľa bandy nájomných "
#~ "jazdcov, a niekoľkým dedinčanom pridelil zásoby zo zbrojnice."

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Mordak, an evil mage, threatens our lives and livelihoods. He is "
#~ "terrorizing our countryside. I've already called the village to arms and "
#~ "now it's up to you to lead them. You'll find him about two days' ride "
#~ "north of here."
#~ msgstr ""
#~ "Naše životy a živobytie ohrozuje zlý mág Mordak. Terorizuje náš vidiek. "
#~ "Už som povolal dedinu do zbrane, a teraz je na tebe, aby si ich viedol. "
#~ "Nájdeš ho asi dva dni jazdy na sever."

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Very well. We will go there and slay this source of evil. Charge, men!"
#~ msgstr "Výborne. Pôjdeme tam a zlikvidujeme ten zdroj zla. Muži, do útoku!"

#~ msgid ""
#~ "I will attempt to sneak through the forest. If I can slay the evil one "
#~ "while he is off his guard, the battle will be over in one stroke!"
#~ msgstr ""
#~ "Pokúsim sa prešmyknúť cez les. Keby sa mi toho zlého podarilo zabiť vo "
#~ "chvíľke nepozornosti, celá bitka by sa vyriešila jediným úderom!"

#~ msgid ""
#~ "This is worrying. What's happened to Bjarn? I suppose we must slay the "
#~ "dark sorcerer ourselves."
#~ msgstr ""
#~ "Znervózňuje ma to. Čo sa stalo Bjarnovi? Myslím, že musíme toho temného "
#~ "čarodeja zabiť sami."

#~ msgid "Good work, men. Now, where is Bjarn?"
#~ msgstr "Dobrá práca, chlapi. Tak, kde je Bjarn?"

#~ msgid "Nothing more to be had from him."
#~ msgstr "Viac sme z neho nedostali."

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Sir, he's been kidnapped! I just saw some men running off with him. They "
#~ "looked like friends of this one."
#~ msgstr ""
#~ "Pane, uniesli ho! Videl som, ako s ním bežali preč nejakí chlapi. "
#~ "Vyzerali ako kamoši tohoto tu."

#~ msgid "Damn! I suppose we have to go after him, then."
#~ msgstr "Do čerta! Nuž myslím, že budeme musieť ísť za ním."

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Ha, so you thought to send a mage around and stab me in the back? Well, I "
#~ "have news for you. We've kidnapped him!"
#~ msgstr ""
#~ "Ha, myslel si si, že pošleš mága okolo, aby ma bodol do chrbta? Nuž, mám "
#~ "pre teba novinku. Uniesli sme ho!"

#~ msgid ""
#~ "What? Bjarn kidnapped? And the evil mage still ravages the land? Noooo!"
#~ msgstr "Čože? Bjarna uniesli? A ten zlý mág stále pustoší krajinu? Nieee!"

#~ msgid "A glorious combat at last, against mounted enemies!"
#~ msgstr "Konečne poriadny boj, proti nepriateľom na koňoch!"

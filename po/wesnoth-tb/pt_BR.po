"\n"
"The last of Mordak’s servants arrived this morning bearing the news of his "
"death, as well as a bundle so well-bound it was barely recognizable as a "
"man. Mordak was always reckless. This whole desperate scheme was his, and I "
"suppose I could blame him for everything that we have suffered through if it "
"still mattered. It was he who brought the wrath of the orcs down on us, too. "
"But all the same, he managed to accomplish what he set out to do. I still "
"cannot believe the finality of what has happened; until now we had always "
"managed to make it through somehow.\n"
"\n"
"We had hoped to deliver the mage to Tairach in return for our lives. I do "
"not know what the warlord wants with this man, but he matches the "
"description. I suppose that Mordak’s plan would have worked perfectly if not "
"for the appearance of the horse warriors. Now they are coming here, led by a "
"man rumored to be this mage's brother. If that is true, he will stop at "
"nothing, no more than would I if they held Mordak.\n"
"\n"
"I have done what I can to fortify this dilapidated castle. The orcs who came "
"with us stand guard at the gates, and I am gathering all of my servants to "
"me in the inner sanctum. But ill fate awaits. Whether I defeat this horse-"
"warrior or no, the orcs will still come for me; they have been scouring the "
"borderlands and raiding the northern farm country in search of us.\n"
"\n"
"Yet for some reason I fear these brothers more. If Mordak were here it would "
"be different, but we are broken...and these two men are whole. In each "
"other, in the ties that bind them, they have strength."

"\n"
"Maghre is looking much better than the last time I saw it. Bjarn has done "
"wonders in two years. The village is rebuilt, and the surrounding farmlands "
"are restored and reoccupied. Despite my brother’s worries, our people have "
"faced no new threats in that time.\n"
"\n"
"It has been more difficult to stay away in those two years, but I have my "
"calling and Bjarn has his, and we have had little opportunity to meet again. "
"But as the company and I are passing through this part of the kingdom with a "
"new patron, I have asked leave of him to visit my brother and he gave it.\n"
"\n"
"This patron is, of all things, an elf. I never thought I'd befriend one, but "
"he is less arrogant the rest. Kalenz, he calls himself. He's seen too much; "
"I can tell that just by meeting his eyes. I think we will have to work for "
"our pay soon.\n"
"\n"
"In the meantime, though, it's good to relax and enjoy the peace."

"man. Mordak was always reckless. This whole desperate scheme was his, and I "
"suppose I could blame him for everything that we have suffered through if it "

"But all the same, he managed to accomplish what he set out to do. I still "
"cannot believe the finality of what has happened; until now we had always "
"managed to make it through somehow.\n"

"We had hoped to deliver the mage to Tairach in return for our lives. I do "
"not know what the warlord wants with this man, but he matches the "
"description. I suppose that Mordak’s plan would have worked perfectly if not "

"This patron is, of all things, an elf. I never thought I’d befriend one, but "

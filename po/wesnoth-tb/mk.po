"hunch was to head north into the borderlands, where the necromancer’s "
"minions could safely hide; everywhere else is more farmland. At first I "

"set of tracks. Some of them had been made by skeletal feet, although after "
"their first campsite the tracks were merely those of men carrying heavy "
"loads.\n"

"Woods. No one from Maghre or any of the other villages has gone into that "
"forest in living memory. Stories have been passed down for generations "
"warning against it. Supposedly the place is haunted by lost souls who hunger "

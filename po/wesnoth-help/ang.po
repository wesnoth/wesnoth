"damage. Most drakes are capable of true flight and can travel long distances "

"somewhat, making them ungainly in the air. Where possible, they make use of "
"terrain features such as hills, mountains and trees as launch points in "
"order to gain greater height and speed. Fortunately for their enemies, they "
"are still quite clumsy creatures and surprisingly slow in combat. This, "
"combined with their large size, renders them easy targets for those who dare "

"fueling their very lives. This can easily be witnessed when one of their "
"kind perishes in combat; its internal fire is released, burning their "
"remains in to ashes. Their internal fire is also their greatest weakness; it "
"makes them extremely vulnerable to cold attacks. Despite their magical "
"nature, drakes are incapable of channeling magic in a controlled manner. "
"While the magic imbued within a drake’s body enables it to spit fire and "

"magic.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Society'</header>\n"
"Drakes are a relatively warlike race and their societies can be best "
"described as cultured martial societies. The core of a drake tribe is a "
"small group of veteran warriors headed by a mutually respected — or simply "
"feared — dominant who rules the society with an iron fist. Every drake is "
"expected to earn their place in the strict hierarchy, to obey their "
"superiors and command their inferiors. Entry to the ruling elite is only "
"possible through challenging and defeating a superior in single combat, "
"which is the way the hierarchy within the elite itself is established. The "
"use of deception of any kind towards any fellow drake is, without exception, "
"seen as cowardly and unacceptable.\n"
"\n"
"While their warlike nature and sense of territory drives them to defend "
"their territories savagely, drakes rarely invade or trespass on areas "
"already occupied by the other major races. Instead, they settle in "
"unpopulated areas to establish their own territory there. They primarily "
"feed on large game they hunt in the lowlands around their homes, but "
"hatchlings and lower caste drakes are known to feed also on certain kinds of "
"moss and fungi they cultivate deep in their caverns. The only technology "
"drakes value is armor- and weapon-smithing, and neither know or need other "
"science and culture besides this. However, the few implements they do "
"fashion are almost unrivaled in quality, only matched by those produced in "
"the finest Dwarvish foundries.\n"
"\n"
"Drakes hatch from eggs and usually live naturally between 20 to 30 years. "
"Death in battle is the most preferred way for a drake to leave this world. "
"Unlike the elder members of other races, drakes naturally grow more "
"aggressive and reckless towards the ends of their natural lives, perhaps to "
"help ensure their place in the heroic legends of their kind.\n"

"Drakes tend to make their homes in mountain caverns near volcanoes to "
"protect their eggs, hatchings and forges. While drakes naturally prefer "
"warmth, their internal fire is more than capable of sustaining them even in "

"Elves spend much of their time honing their talents and skills. Those not "

"skills. As a result, elves excel at archery, which is perhaps their most "
"important method of warfare. Most elvish troops carry a bow and no other "
"race can rival their archers in speed and accuracy. All elves also share an "
"intense affection for unspoiled nature. They often feel uncomfortable in "

"the great northern woods of which the Lintanir Forest is the southernmost "

"animosity. Occasionally, a single strong chieftain may emerge to lead "
"multiple tribes from time to time, usually through intimidation of "

"strengthening itself in preparation for the next armed conflict. Orcs are "
"known to possess a crude system of writing — usually in blood — although "
"it’s most commonly used to trade insults or threats among tribal leaders.\n"
"\n"
"Orc societies are based on little else but strength; might makes right, and "
"a leader leads and survives only as long as no one manages to wrest the "
"title from him. A constant struggle for power simmers among potential tribal "
"chiefs. An orcish leader rarely lives more than a handful of years to enjoy "

"history knows some notable exceptions. Orcs hold no particular honor code "
"and while indisputable raw strength is usually the preferred method of "
"displaying power, assassination, poisoning and backstabbing are completely "
"viable means to further one’s own goals.\n"
"\n"
"Orcs mostly live in rural areas, often in foothills or mountainous regions, "
"sometimes in caves. They grow no crops nor keep livestock, but are competent "
"hunters as a result of their physical stature and brutality. Due to their "
"large numbers they are capable of hunting an area virtually clean of "
"anything larger than rodents in relatively short period of time. Due to this "
"and their unstable leadership, orcish tribes tend to lead a semi-nomadic "
"lifestyle, never settling in one region for too long. The larger tribes may "
"establish themselves firmly in an area for years or even decades and build "
"large encampments almost resembling cities, but even these are easily "
"dismantled and abandoned if there is a need to relocate the horde.\n"
"\n"
"The oldest known orcs have been around 50 to 60 years of age, but very few "
"individuals ever live to see over two or three decades before meeting their "
"end either in war or by the hand of one of their kin. The oldest orcs are "
"often shamans, which are perhaps the only ones most of their kind sees as "
"being trustworthy and neutral. The origins of this custom are unknown, as "
"the shamans do not directly contribute much to orcish societies but only act "
"as advisors — not something orcs tend to otherwise tolerate. Shamans are in "
"many ways the opposite of most other orcs: they are often physically "
"withered and frail in comparison and lack skill in battle. Despite their "
"reliance on raw strength, not nearly all orcs are destined to grow to "
"possess any. Many orcs are born smaller and weaker than the rest, and "
"already almost as newborns are put in their place by their stronger "
"siblings. The stronger ones will routinely grab most of the food and thus "
"grow stronger still, while their weaker siblings do not. Many of these "

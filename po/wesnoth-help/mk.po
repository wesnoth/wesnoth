"Drakes are large, winged and fire-breathing creatures, reminiscent of true "

"easily weighs more than a man and a horse combined. Their skin is made up of "
"hard scales, resistant to most physical strikes except piercing and cold "
"damage. Most drakes are capable of true flight and can travel long distances "
"quickly. However, their sheer weight and bulk limits their flight ability "
"somewhat, making them ungainly in the air. Where possible, they make use of "
"terrain features such as hills, mountains and trees as launch points in "
"order to gain greater height and speed. Fortunately for their enemies, they "
"are still quite clumsy creatures and surprisingly slow in combat. This, "
"combined with their large size, renders them easy targets for those who dare "

"fueling their very lives. This can easily be witnessed when one of their "
"kind perishes in combat; its internal fire is released, burning their "

"makes them extremely vulnerable to cold attacks. Despite their magical "

"expected to earn their place in the strict hierarchy, to obey their "
"superiors and command their inferiors. Entry to the ruling elite is only "
"possible through challenging and defeating a superior in single combat, "
"which is the way the hierarchy within the elite itself is established. The "
"use of deception of any kind towards any fellow drake is, without exception, "
"seen as cowardly and unacceptable.\n"
"\n"
"While their warlike nature and sense of territory drives them to defend "
"their territories savagely, drakes rarely invade or trespass on areas "
"already occupied by the other major races. Instead, they settle in "
"unpopulated areas to establish their own territory there. They primarily "
"feed on large game they hunt in the lowlands around their homes, but "
"hatchlings and lower caste drakes are known to feed also on certain kinds of "
"moss and fungi they cultivate deep in their caverns. The only technology "
"drakes value is armor- and weapon-smithing, and neither know or need other "
"science and culture besides this. However the few implements they do fashion "
"are almost unrivaled in quality, only matched by those produced in the "

"The dwarves are a race famed for their miners, blacksmiths, merchants and "
"warriors. Considered as the third oldest race on the great continent after "
"the elves and trolls, their early history is shrouded in mystery. Legends "
"tell of a time long forgotten when their people began emerging from their "
"underground world through caves. Nothing is known about their life prior to "
"their arrival, or their reasons for entering the surface world, but they "
"have been an integral part of the history of the continent since. Soon after "
"their emergence from the underground, the dwarves entered into conflict with "
"the original inhabitants of the land, the elves. The original reason for "
"their dispute has been lost to history, but the two races have since fought "
"three long wars, interrupted by a few decades of peace. During these wars "
"the dwarves could not dislodge the elves from the deep forests in the south, "
"but managed to consolidate their position in hills and the mountains in the "
"north of the continent, known now as the Northlands. Since then they have "
"constructed fantastic fortifications and settlements deep within the "
"mountains and crags of their territory.\n"
"\n"
"Possibly due to their isolation, the dwarves are generally distrustful or "
"hostile towards most other races, particularly the elves. The single "
"exception to this temperament is towards humans. This could be traced back "
"to the era of Haldric I and the arrival of humans and orcs to the continent. "
"At this point the dwarves began allowing some humans, mostly dissidents and "
"outlaws from the Kingdom of Wesnoth, to settle in certain areas of the "
"Northlands. Their motivation was unsurprising. The plight of these "
"individuals reminded the dwarves of their early history of persecution, "
"eliciting a sense of solidarity. The dwarves also had much to gain in "
"forming a bond with these outcasts. They would settle in areas where dwarves "
"disliked living themselves; plains, forests, and swamps, freeing them from "
"defending these areas.\n"
"\n"
"Dwarves are of small stature by human measure, but they are by no means "
"fragile. Their warriors, tough and powerful are both feared and respected "
"throughout the continent for their prowess in battle. In addition, dwarves "
"are known for their calculating intellects and superb craftsmanship. Dwarven "
"smiths are renowned for their deadly weapons and heavy armor. These "
"accouterments are unrivaled in quality, possibly only matched by those "
"produced by drake armorers. Their intelligence and natural inquisitiveness "
"has also made them the most technically advanced race on the continent. One "
"of their most famous, and feared, discoveries was a mysterious powder that "
"produces an immense explosion when exposed to fire or sparks. Certain dwarf "
"warriors use this powder to hurl small objects at tremendous speeds. Given "
"their technological inclinations, many dwarves tend to distrust magic users. "
"However some practice a form of magic based on the engraving of runes. "
"Called runesmiths, they use these carvings to enchant items in order to "
"augment certain aspects of their natures."

"Orc societies are based on little else but strength; might makes right, and "

"\n"
"Orcs mostly live in rural areas, often in foothills or mountainous regions, "

"large numbers they are capable of hunting an area virtually clean of "

"often shamans, which are perhaps the only ones most of their kind sees as "
"being trustworthy and neutral. The origins of this custom are unknown, as "
"the shamans do not directly contribute much to orcish societies but only act "
"as advisors — not something orcs tend to otherwise tolerate. Shamans are in "
"many ways the opposite of most other orcs: they are often physically "
"withered and frail in comparison and lack skill in battle. Despite their "
"reliance on raw strength, not nearly all orcs are destined to grow to "
"possess any. Many orcs are born smaller and weaker than the rest, and "

"The mighty wose resides within the deepest forests of the known world. To "
"the untrained eye, the wose appears to be nothing more than an oddly shaped, "
"yet noble, tree. As guardians of the forest, the woses share a deeper "
"connection to the woodlands than even the elves. While the woses are a "
"peaceful race, disturbance of the ancient forests, which they tend, will "
"incite the wrath of nature itself. Woses are slow moving creatures that may "
"spend centuries standing in one location undisturbed by the ebb and flow of "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"Although they practice no magic of their own, the woses share a deep "
"connection to faerie. What little is known of this ancient race comes from "
"elvish scholars who believe that this mystical power, which the mightiest "
"elves have dedicated their lives to master, is inherent to the wose. Though "
"woses resemble them, they share no ancestry with trees. Woses are believed "
"to be some of the oldest creatures in the world, perhaps even more ancient "
"than the forests in which they dwell, and it is thought that the power of "
"faerie has given these beings the eternal task of serving as wardens of the "
"forest.\n"
"\n"
"Woses are not warlike in the least and are ill-accustomed to combat. They "
"will however respond with indiscriminate violence in defense of their "
"forested territory. Woses are slow moving and are vulnerable away from the "
"woodlands. Due to their close connection with faerie, woses are particularly "
"sensitive to the arcane. The hardwood that makes the wose nigh-impervious to "
"physical assault has left it grievously vulnerable to flame. Their thick "
"bark and ability to harness the power of faerie to regenerate quickly when "
"injured allows the wose to survive an enemy onslaught long enough to respond "
"with a crushing might belied by its peaceful, plodding nature. Within its "
"forest home, the wose can disappear amongst the trees and ambush even the "
"best-trained elvish scout.\n"
"\n"
"The life span of the wose is unknown, although the most ancient members of "
"this race have lived many hundreds of years and have grown to massive "
"heights. It is thought that unless a wose falls in battle, it will find no "
"natural end. Content to pass the centuries standing like a sentry, "
"uninterested in the goings-on of the civilized world, the wose will stir "
"only to march to the defense of the natural world and the forests it calls "
"home."

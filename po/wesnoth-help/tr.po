#~ "small group of veteran warriors headed by a mutually respected — or "
#~ "simply feared — leader who rules the society with an iron fist. Every "
#~ "drake is expected to earn their place in the strict hierarchy, to obey "
#~ "their superiors and command their inferiors. Entry to the ruling elite is "
#~ "only possible through challenging and defeating a superior in single "

#~ "While their warlike nature and sense of territory drives them to defend "
#~ "their territories savagely, drakes rarely invade or trespass on areas "
#~ "already occupied by the other major races. Instead, they settle in "

#~ "feed on large game they hunt in the lowlands around their homes, but "
#~ "hatchlings and lower caste drakes are known to feed also on certain of "
#~ "moss and fungi they cultivate deep in their caverns. The only technology "
#~ "drakes value is armor- and weapon-smithing, and neither know or need "
#~ "other science and culture besides this. However the few implements they "

#~ "areas of the Northlands. Their motivation was unsurprising. The plight of "
#~ "these individuals reminded the dwarves of their early history of "
#~ "persecution, eliciting a sense of solidarity. The dwarves also had much "
#~ "to gain in forming a bond with these outcasts. They would settle in areas "

#~ "was a mysterious powder that produces an immense explosion when exposed "
#~ "to fire or sparks. Certain dwarf warriors use this powder to hurl small "
#~ "objects at tremendous speeds. Given their technological inclinations, "

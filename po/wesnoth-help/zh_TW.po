"Drakes are large, winged and fire-breathing creatures, reminiscent of true "
"dragons. On average, an adult drake stands around three meters tall and "
"easily weighs more than a man and a horse combined. Their skin is made up of "
"hard scales, resistant to most physical strikes except piercing and cold "
"damage. Most drakes are capable of true flight and can travel long distances "
"quickly. However, their sheer weight and bulk limits their flight ability "
"somewhat, making them ungainly in the air. Where possible, they make use of "
"terrain features such as hills, mountains and trees as launch points in "
"order to gain greater height and speed. Fortunately for their enemies, they "
"are still quite clumsy creatures and surprisingly slow in combat. This, "
"combined with their large size, renders them easy targets for those who dare "
"attack them.\n"
"\n"
"Drakes are inherently magical creatures, with a mysterious internal fire "
"fueling their very lives. This can easily be witnessed when one of their "
"kind perishes in combat; its internal fire is released, burning their "
"remains in to ashes. Their internal fire is also their greatest weakness; it "
"makes them extremely vulnerable to cold attacks. Despite their magical "
"nature, drakes are incapable of channeling magic in a controlled manner. "
"While the magic imbued within a drake’s body enables it to spit fire and "
"gives it life, they have no willful control over the functions of this "
"magic.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Society'</header>\n"
"Drakes are a relatively warlike race and their societies can be best "
"described as cultured martial societies. The core of a drake tribe is a "
"small group of veteran warriors headed by a mutually respected — or simply "
"feared — dominant who rules the society with an iron fist. Every drake is "
"expected to earn their place in the strict hierarchy, to obey their "
"superiors and command their inferiors. Entry to the ruling elite is only "
"possible through challenging and defeating a superior in single combat, "
"which is the way the hierarchy within the elite itself is established. The "
"use of deception of any kind towards any fellow drake is, without exception, "
"seen as cowardly and unacceptable.\n"
"\n"
"While their warlike nature and sense of territory drives them to defend "
"their territories savagely, drakes rarely invade or trespass on areas "
"already occupied by the other major races. Instead, they settle in "
"unpopulated areas to establish their own territory there. They primarily "
"feed on large game they hunt in the lowlands around their homes, but "
"hatchlings and lower caste drakes are known to feed also on certain kinds of "
"moss and fungi they cultivate deep in their caverns. The only technology "
"drakes value is armor- and weapon-smithing, and neither know or need other "
"science and culture besides this. However, the few implements they do "
"fashion are almost unrivaled in quality, only matched by those produced in "
"the finest Dwarvish foundries.\n"
"\n"
"Drakes hatch from eggs and usually live naturally between 20 to 30 years. "
"Death in battle is the most preferred way for a drake to leave this world. "
"Unlike the elder members of other races, drakes naturally grow more "
"aggressive and reckless towards the ends of their natural lives, perhaps to "
"help ensure their place in the heroic legends of their kind.\n"
"\n"

"Drakes originated from an archipelago of volcanic islands called "
"<ref>dst='morogor' text='Morogor'</ref> in the <ref>dst='great_ocean' "

"subsidence of many of their home islands has caused colonies of drakes to "

"Drakes tend to make their homes in mountain caverns near volcanoes to "
"protect their eggs, hatchings and forges. While drakes naturally prefer "

"The dwarves are a race famed for their miners, blacksmiths, merchants and "

"tell of a time long forgotten when their people began emerging from their "
"underground world through caves. Nothing is known about their life prior to "
"their arrival, or their reasons for entering the surface world, but they "
"have been an integral part of the history of the continent since. Soon after "
"their emergence from the underground, the dwarves entered into conflict with "
"the original inhabitants of the land, the elves. The original reason for "
"their dispute has been lost to history, but the two races have since fought "
"three long wars, interrupted by a few decades of peace. During these wars "
"the dwarves could not dislodge the elves from the deep forests in the south, "
"but managed to consolidate their position in hills and the mountains in the "
"north of the continent, known now as the Northlands. Since then they have "
"constructed fantastic fortifications and settlements deep within the "
"mountains and crags of their territory.\n"
"\n"
"Possibly due to their isolation, the dwarves are generally distrustful or "
"hostile towards most other races, particularly the elves. The single "
"exception to this temperament is towards humans. This could be traced back "
"to the era of Haldric I and the arrival of humans and orcs to the continent. "
"At this point the dwarves began allowing some humans, mostly dissidents and "
"outlaws from the Kingdom of Wesnoth, to settle in certain areas of the "
"Northlands. Their motivation was unsurprising. The plight of these "
"individuals reminded the dwarves of their early history of persecution, "
"eliciting a sense of solidarity. The dwarves also had much to gain in "
"forming a bond with these outcasts. They would settle in areas where dwarves "
"disliked living themselves; plains, forests, and swamps, freeing them from "
"defending these areas.\n"

"fragile. Their warriors, tough and powerful are both feared and respected "

"produces an immense explosion when exposed to fire or sparks. Certain dwarf "
"warriors use this powder to hurl small objects at tremendous speeds. Given "

"However some practice a form of magic based on the engraving of runes. "

"At the same time, this analytical mindset has distanced them from magical "
"arts; to the rational mind, magic is uncontrollable, unpredictable, and "
"hence unreliable. For this reason, the Dunefolk especially loathe the "
"perversions of necromancy and the dark arts, even more so than other races.\n"
"\n"
"The Dunefolk’s inquisitive and explorative nature does not preclude military "
"strength. Not only do they field nimble light troops, cataphracts, and "
"heavily armored infantry, but their keen knowledge of technology grants them "
"a decisive advantage over their opponents. When facing the Dunefolk in "
"battle, however, the most fearsome sight is certainly their deployment of "

"The mighty wose resides within the deepest forests of the known world. To "
"the untrained eye, the wose appears to be nothing more than an oddly shaped, "
"yet noble, tree. As guardians of the forest, the woses share a deeper "
"connection to the woodlands than even the elves. While the woses are a "
"peaceful race, disturbance of the ancient forests, which they tend, will "
"incite the wrath of nature itself. Woses are slow moving creatures that may "
"spend centuries standing in one location undisturbed by the ebb and flow of "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"Although they practice no magic of their own, the woses share a deep "
"connection to faerie. What little is known of this ancient race comes from "
"elvish scholars who believe that this mystical power, which the mightiest "
"elves have dedicated their lives to master, is inherent to the wose. Though "
"woses resemble them, they share no ancestry with trees. Woses are believed "
"to be some of the oldest creatures in the world, perhaps even more ancient "
"than the forests in which they dwell, and it is thought that the power of "
"faerie has given these beings the eternal task of serving as wardens of the "
"forest.\n"
"\n"
"Woses are not warlike in the least and are ill-accustomed to combat. They "
"will however respond with indiscriminate violence in defense of their "
"forested territory. Woses are slow moving and are vulnerable away from the "
"woodlands. Due to their close connection with faerie, woses are particularly "
"sensitive to the arcane. The hardwood that makes the wose nigh-impervious to "
"physical assault has left it grievously vulnerable to flame. Their thick "
"bark and ability to harness the power of faerie to regenerate quickly when "
"injured allows the wose to survive an enemy onslaught long enough to respond "
"with a crushing might belied by its peaceful, plodding nature. Within its "
"forest home, the wose can disappear amongst the trees and ambush even the "
"best-trained elvish scout.\n"
"\n"
"The life span of the wose is unknown, although the most ancient members of "
"this race have lived many hundreds of years and have grown to massive "
"heights. It is thought that unless a wose falls in battle, it will find no "
"natural end. Content to pass the centuries standing like a sentry, "
"uninterested in the goings-on of the civilized world, the wose will stir "
"only to march to the defense of the natural world and the forests it calls "
"home."

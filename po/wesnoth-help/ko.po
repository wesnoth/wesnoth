"Drakes are a relatively warlike race and their societies can be best "
"described as cultured martial societies. The core of a drake tribe is a "
"small group of veteran warriors headed by a mutually respected — or simply "
"feared — dominant who rules the society with an iron fist. Every drake is "
"expected to earn their place in the strict hierarchy, to obey their "
"superiors and command their inferiors. Entry to the ruling elite is only "
"possible through challenging and defeating a superior in single combat, "
"which is the way the hierarchy within the elite itself is established. The "
"use of deception of any kind towards any fellow drake is, without exception, "
"seen as cowardly and unacceptable.\n"
"\n"
"While their warlike nature and sense of territory drives them to defend "
"their territories savagely, drakes rarely invade or trespass on areas "
"already occupied by the other major races. Instead, they settle in "
"unpopulated areas to establish their own territory there. They primarily "
"feed on large game they hunt in the lowlands around their homes, but "
"hatchlings and lower caste drakes are known to feed also on certain kinds of "
"moss and fungi they cultivate deep in their caverns. Drakes value armor- and "
"weapon-smithing, but neither know nor need other science and culture besides "
"this. Nonetheless, the few implements they do fashion are almost unrivaled "
"in quality, only matched by those produced in the finest Dwarvish "
"foundries.\n"
"\n"
"Drakes hatch from eggs and may live naturally for several decades, although "

"The dwarves are a race famed for their miners, blacksmiths, merchants and "

"tell of a time long forgotten when their people began emerging from their "
"underground world through caves. Nothing is known about their life prior to "
"their arrival, or their reasons for entering the surface world, but they "
"have been an integral part of the history of the continent since. Soon after "
"their emergence from the underground, the dwarves entered into conflict with "
"the original inhabitants of the land, the elves. The original reason for "
"their dispute has been lost to history, but the two races have since fought "
"three long wars, interrupted by a few decades of peace. During these wars "
"the dwarves could not dislodge the elves from the deep forests in the south, "
"but managed to consolidate their position in hills and the mountains in the "
"north of the continent, known now as the Northlands. Since then they have "
"constructed fantastic fortifications and settlements deep within the "
"mountains and crags of their territory.\n"
"\n"
"Possibly due to their isolation, the dwarves are generally distrustful or "
"hostile towards most other races, particularly the elves. The single "
"exception to this temperament is towards humans. This could be traced back "
"to the era of Haldric I and the arrival of humans and orcs to the continent. "
"At this point the dwarves began allowing some humans, mostly dissidents and "
"outlaws from the Kingdom of Wesnoth, to settle in certain areas of the "
"Northlands. Their motivation was unsurprising. The plight of these "
"individuals reminded the dwarves of their early history of persecution, "
"eliciting a sense of solidarity. The dwarves also had much to gain in "
"forming a bond with these outcasts. They would settle in areas where dwarves "
"disliked living themselves; plains, forests, and swamps, freeing them from "
"defending these areas.\n"
"\n"
"Dwarves are of small stature by human measure, but they are by no means "
"fragile. Their warriors, tough and powerful are both feared and respected "
"throughout the continent for their prowess in battle. In addition, dwarves "
"are known for their calculating intellects and superb craftsmanship. Dwarven "
"smiths are renowned for their deadly weapons and heavy armor. These "
"accouterments are unrivaled in quality, possibly only matched by those "
"produced by drake armorers. Their intelligence and natural inquisitiveness "
"has also made them the most technically advanced race on the continent. One "
"of their most famous, and feared, discoveries was a mysterious powder that "
"produces an immense explosion when exposed to fire or sparks. Certain dwarf "
"warriors use this powder to hurl small objects at tremendous speeds. Given "
"their technological inclinations, many dwarves tend to distrust magic users. "
"However, some practice a form of magic based on the engraving of runes. "
"Called runesmiths, they use these carvings to enchant items in order to "
"augment certain aspects of their natures."

"<header>text='Magic'</header>\n"
"While elves are fundamentally different creatures than the fabled fair folk, "

"between two different paths, one focused on manipulation of the mundane or "

"common is the the way of corporeal alteration, which has more tangible "
"effects than its antithesis in the arcane. Though elven nature magic is ill-"
"suited toward combat, its potent ability to harness earthly energies to "
"nurture and protect is the primary reason for the effectiveness of elven "
"healing as well as the beauty and vitality of their forests.\n"
"\n"
"Those who follow the mystic path are also well-regarded by other elves, but "
"their motives and abilities are often unclear to those outside of their "

"\n"
"<header>text='Culture'</header>\n"
"Elves spend much of their time honing their talents and skills. Those not "
"adept at the magical arts typically devote their time honing their physical "
"skills, often for sporting purposes. As a result, elves excel at archery, a "
"craft that is readily and effectively applied to warfare. Elves are also "
"renowned musicians, particularly skilled at wind and plucked string "
"instruments in small ensembles. The Aeolian harps of the Aethenwood, for "
"example, are crafted from the fine wood of Elven yew trees and are legendary "
"for their soft, gentle tone.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Society'</header>\n"
"Elvish society is roughly divided into three factions: a pseudo-military "
"faction responsible for defending their forests, peaceful civilians who are "
"usually craftsmen and artists, and healers and mystics who maintain the "
"elves’ connection to the faerie. Responsible for governing these different "
"aspects is the nobility, who are treated as servants to the broader social "
"order, rather than as strict rulers of their people. The process for "
"selecting these nobles differs between the various elven conclaves, with the "
"governing council of Wesmere — the Ka’lian — being elected and the nobility "
"in Lintanir usually being inherited.\n"
"\n"
"In times of strife, the hierarchy of command becomes more adaptable, with "
"the ordinary aristocracy deferring to more war-minded marshals. By "
"tradition, in both Wesmere and Lintanir, an enchantress from the order of "
"elven mystics is also called upon to facilitate the transition of power."

"war, or as escorts for trading caravans during times of peace.\n"
"\n"
"The Dunefolk’s inclination towards trade and exploration has allowed their "
"cities to amass immense fortunes, a fact regarded both with admiration and "
"envy by other races. Mutual interests have fostered cordial relations with "
"neighboring Naga tribes, but more secretive races such as Drakes and Elves "
"have always considered Dunefolk expeditions to be too intrusive, especially "
"when they venture close to territorial boundaries. It is not uncommon for "
"caravans to fall prey to troll ambushes in the mountains, something that has "
"given rise to countless tales of unimaginable treasure amassed in hidden "
"caves.\n"
"\n"
"As a result of living in hostile environments for centuries, the Dunefolk "
"have developed rational methods of enquiry through which they continue to "
"improve their understanding of the world. Their study of herbal medicine "
"keeps their warriors and workers fresh and healthy. Their knowledge of "
"alchemy allows them to tame fire and wield it as a deadly weapon in battle. "
"At the same time, this analytical mindset has distanced them from magical "
"arts; to the rational mind, magic is uncontrollable, unpredictable, and "
"hence unreliable. For this reason, the Dunefolk especially loathe the "
"perversions of necromancy and the dark arts, even more so than other races.\n"
"\n"
"The Dunefolk’s inquisitive and explorative nature does not preclude military "
"strength. Not only do they field nimble light troops, cataphracts, and "
"heavily armored infantry, but their keen knowledge of technology grants them "
"a decisive advantage over their opponents. When facing the Dunefolk in "
"battle, however, the most fearsome sight is certainly their deployment of "
"ferocious and bizarre beasts. From the majestic Roc to the imposing Wyvern, "
"their synergy with these creatures allows for great versatility in combat. "
"The origins of this tradition likely lie in the heritage of the Dunefolk’s "
"distant past in the exotic far corners of Irdya."

"Saurians are lizard-like creatures. Smaller and more slender than humans, "
"they rarely stand taller than a ten year old child, though from tip of snout "
"to end of tail a Saurian can be as long as the average man is tall. Light "
"and nimble, the warriors prefer to fight as they hunt — slipping through "
"enemy lines to target the weak and the injured while evading their "
"attackers.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Society'</header>\n"
"Saurians are very mysterious creatures due to their tendency to live in "
"areas inhospitable to others, such as swamps. Fatalistic in the extreme, "
"Saurians believe all the events in a life can be predicted by the use of a "
"complex form of astrology.\n"
"\n"
"Saurian culture is sharply segregated between the genders. Within each "
"gender the members compete, and through skill, determination, and reputation "
"establish a clear pecking order, with a chief at the top. On those occasions "
"when the two genders interact they do not contest for dominance; instead, "
"the situation determines the dominant gender. The chief of the males is "
"alpha within the clan's village or encampment while the chief of females is "
"dominant anywhere else. This continues down the rank structure with each "
"male or female being dominant over any member of the opposite gender with "
"lower rank and submitting to members of the opposite gender with higher "
"rank.\n"
"\n"
"The segregation and alternating gender-dominance of Saurian society is an "
"outgrowth of their clearly defined gender roles. It is the responsibility of "
"the female to hunt and find food, skills which ultimately train them to be "
"warriors: the skirmishers, flankers, and ambushers other races so fear. "
"Males, meanwhile, are responsible for guarding the clutch — the eggs left by "
"the females. While this leaves time for the males to develop and hone the "
"arts of astrology, healing, and magic, it also exposes them to significant "
"danger, as they are stationary targets for a Saurian clan's number one enemy "
"— other Saurian clans.\n"
"\n"
"New Saurian clans are started when the proper astrological signs are read. "
"Called a “hatching,” each female indicated by the conjunction selects a "
"group of individuals with lower rank and leave their source clan. Frequently "
"all females with a specific trait will be indicated, causing multiple clans "
"to “hatch” at the same time. Selection is a simple process: no group leaving "
"can be larger than any other, all the groups together cannot be larger than "
"the group being left, and higher ranking allows a female to overrule another "
"female's choice of who they take.\n"
"\n"
"Because of their rapid population growth, frequent splits in clans, and the "
"fact that cannibalism is not taboo, violence is one of the defining features "
"of Saurian life. This limits the growth of the Saurian culture to fits and "
"starts, as much of their knowledge is passed by oral tradition and their "
"possessions must be mobile.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Geography'</header>\n"
"Saurians can live in many different areas, though swamps are by far their "
"most common habitat.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Biology'</header>\n"
"Saurians live spectacularly short lives by comparison to most of the other "
"races of Wesnoth, reaching full adulthood within three years and often dying "
"by the time they are 10 to 15 years old. By far, the most common cause of "
"death is violence. Saurian females produce clutches of about 20 eggs roughly "
"once a year, which creates constant population pressure and would stress "
"most carnivores' food supply. Hunters and scavengers, Saurians have "
"extremely strong jaws and have a very powerful digestive system with highly "
"acidic fluids, making them capable of eating and digesting all of their prey "
"including skin, teeth, horns and bones. Further, they have no aversion to "
"eating carrion and even committing cannibalism, which are both regular "
"occurrences."

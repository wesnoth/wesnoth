"\n"
"Over the River Aethen, south of Fort Tahn, is a Wesnothian frontier region. "
"It is bounded to the south (off-map) by dense woods of which the Aethenwood "

"east of the Weldyn River. The northernmost portion, nearest the River "
"Weldyn, has at various times been settled by Wesnothians, but the Kingdom's "

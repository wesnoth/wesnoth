"members of the same race. While other races usually bear children singly or "
"in pairs, orcs will have large litters of children all at once, causing "
"their populations to explode rather quickly. Within any litter, there will "
"only be one or two true orcs, who will grow to the full size and strength of "
"their race. A few more will be half-orcs, notably weaker than their big "
"brothers, and relegated to supporting roles in combat, such as archery. The "
"rest, often a full half of more of any litter, will be goblins. Goblins are "
"puny and quite frail, rarely growing past the size and stature of a human "
"child. Goblins are born into a lifetime of near-slavery to their larger kin, "
"and used as sword-fodder in battle. They thrive in spite of their tragic "
"fate; in part because they are so very numerous, and also because their "
"brother orcs are well aware how dependent they are on the goblins.\n"

"Goblins perform the bulk of manual labour needed by the orcs, with the sole "
"exception of jobs that require the brute strength of true orcs. Those the "
"orcs revel in as proof of their prowess."

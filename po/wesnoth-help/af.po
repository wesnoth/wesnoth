"Drakes are large, winged and fire-breathing creatures, reminiscent of true "

"easily weighs more than a man and a horse combined. Their skin is made up of "
"hard scales, resistant to most physical strikes except piercing and cold "
"damage. Most drakes are capable of true flight and can travel long distances "
"quickly. However, their sheer weight and bulk limits their flight ability "
"somewhat, making them ungainly in the air. Where possible, they make use of "
"terrain features such as hills, mountains and trees as launch points in "
"order to gain greater height and speed. Fortunately for their enemies, their "
"large size renders them easy targets for those who dare attack them.\n"
"\n"
"Drakes are inherently magical creatures, with a mysterious internal fire "
"fueling their very lives. This can easily be witnessed when one of their "
"kind perishes in combat; its internal fire is released, burning their "
"remains into ashes. Their internal fire is also their greatest weakness; it "
"makes them extremely vulnerable to cold attacks. Despite their magical "
"nature, drakes are incapable of channeling magic in a controlled manner. "
"While the magic imbued within a drake’s body enables it to spit fire and "
"gives it life, they have no willful control over the functions of this "
"magic.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Society'</header>\n"
"Drakes are a relatively warlike race and their societies can be best "
"described as cultured martial societies. The core of a drake tribe is a "
"small group of veteran warriors headed by a mutually respected — or simply "
"feared — dominant who rules the society with an iron fist. Every drake is "
"expected to earn their place in the strict hierarchy, to obey their "
"superiors and command their inferiors. Entry to the ruling elite is only "
"possible through challenging and defeating a superior in single combat, "
"which is the way the hierarchy within the elite itself is established. The "
"use of deception of any kind towards any fellow drake is, without exception, "
"seen as cowardly and unacceptable.\n"
"\n"
"While their warlike nature and sense of territory drives them to defend "
"their territories savagely, drakes rarely invade or trespass on areas "
"already occupied by the other major races. Instead, they settle in "
"unpopulated areas to establish their own territory there. They primarily "
"feed on large game they hunt in the lowlands around their homes, but "
"hatchlings and lower caste drakes are known to feed also on certain kinds of "
"moss and fungi they cultivate deep in their caverns. Drakes value armor- and "
"weapon-smithing, but neither know nor need other science and culture besides "
"this. Nonetheless, the few implements they do fashion are almost unrivaled "
"in quality, only matched by those produced in the finest Dwarvish "
"foundries.\n"
"\n"
"Drakes hatch from eggs and may live naturally for several decades, although "
"some have been known to survive for longer. However, death in battle is the "
"most preferred way for a drake to leave this world. As such, most drakes do "
"not live to see the end of their natural lifespan.\n"
"\n"

"Drakes originated from an archipelago of volcanic islands called "
"<ref>dst='morogor' text='Morogor'</ref> in the <ref>dst='great_ocean' "

"protect their eggs, hatchings and forges. While drakes naturally prefer "

"The dwarves are a race famed for their miners, blacksmiths, merchants and "
"warriors. Considered as the third oldest race on the great continent after "
"the elves and trolls, their early history is shrouded in mystery. Legends "
"tell of a time long forgotten when their people began emerging from their "
"underground world through caves. Nothing is known about their life prior to "
"their arrival, or their reasons for entering the surface world, but they "
"have been an integral part of the history of the continent since. Soon after "
"their emergence from the underground, the dwarves entered into conflict with "
"the original inhabitants of the land, the elves. The original reason for "
"their dispute has been lost to history, but the two races have since fought "
"three long wars, interrupted by a few decades of peace. During these wars "
"the dwarves could not dislodge the elves from the deep forests in the south, "
"but managed to consolidate their position in hills and the mountains in the "
"north of the continent, known now as the Northlands. Since then they have "
"constructed fantastic fortifications and settlements deep within the "
"mountains and crags of their territory.\n"
"\n"
"Possibly due to their isolation, the dwarves are generally distrustful or "
"hostile towards most other races, particularly the elves. The single "
"exception to this temperament is towards humans. This could be traced back "
"to the era of Haldric I and the arrival of humans and orcs to the continent. "
"At this point the dwarves began allowing some humans, mostly dissidents and "
"outlaws from the Kingdom of Wesnoth, to settle in certain areas of the "
"Northlands. Their motivation was unsurprising. The plight of these "
"individuals reminded the dwarves of their early history of persecution, "
"eliciting a sense of solidarity. The dwarves also had much to gain in "
"forming a bond with these outcasts. They would settle in areas where dwarves "
"disliked living themselves; plains, forests, and swamps, freeing them from "
"defending these areas.\n"
"\n"
"Dwarves are of small stature by human measure, but they are by no means "
"fragile. Their warriors, tough and powerful are both feared and respected "
"throughout the continent for their prowess in battle. In addition, dwarves "
"are known for their calculating intellects and superb craftsmanship. Dwarven "
"smiths are renowned for their deadly weapons and heavy armor. These "
"accouterments are unrivaled in quality, possibly only matched by those "
"produced by drake armorers. Their intelligence and natural inquisitiveness "
"has also made them the most technically advanced race on the continent. One "
"of their most famous, and feared, discoveries was a mysterious powder that "
"produces an immense explosion when exposed to fire or sparks. Certain dwarf "
"warriors use this powder to hurl small objects at tremendous speeds. Given "
"their technological inclinations, many dwarves tend to distrust magic users. "
"However, some practice a form of magic based on the engraving of runes. "
"Called runesmiths, they use these carvings to enchant items in order to "
"augment certain aspects of their natures."

"\n"
"<header>text='Magic'</header>\n"
"While elves are fundamentally different creatures than the fabled fair folk, "
"their magic has some connection to the faerie and is the source of their "
"unusually keen senses as well as their long lives. Elven magic is split "
"between two different paths, one focused on manipulation of the mundane or "
"natural world, and one focused on divination into the arcane plane. More "
"common is the the way of corporeal alteration, which has more tangible "
"effects than its antithesis in the arcane. Though elven nature magic is ill-"
"suited toward combat, its potent ability to harness earthly energies to "
"nurture and protect is the primary reason for the effectiveness of elven "
"healing as well as the beauty and vitality of their forests.\n"
"\n"
"Those who follow the mystic path are also well-regarded by other elves, but "
"their motives and abilities are often unclear to those outside of their "
"order. Some who venture far down the path of mysticism take on more faerie-"
"like traits, gaining extraordinary insight and longevity, but also becoming "
"sensitive to and even burned by the presence of cold iron.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Culture'</header>\n"
"Elves spend much of their time honing their talents and skills. Those not "
"adept at the magical arts typically devote their time honing their physical "
"skills, often for sporting purposes. As a result, elves excel at archery, a "
"craft that is readily and effectively applied to warfare. Elves are also "
"renowned musicians, particularly skilled at wind and plucked string "
"instruments in small ensembles. The Aeolian harps of the Aethenwood, for "
"example, are crafted from the fine wood of Elven yew trees and are legendary "
"for their soft, gentle tone.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Society'</header>\n"
"Elvish society is roughly divided into three factions: a pseudo-military "
"faction responsible for defending their forests, peaceful civilians who are "
"usually craftsmen and artists, and healers and mystics who maintain the "
"elves’ connection to the faerie. Responsible for governing these different "
"aspects is the nobility, who are treated as servants to the broader social "
"order, rather than as strict rulers of their people. The process for "
"selecting these nobles differs between the various elven conclaves, with the "
"governing council of Wesmere — the Ka’lian — being elected and the nobility "
"in Lintanir usually being inherited.\n"
"\n"
"In times of strife, the hierarchy of command becomes more adaptable, with "
"the ordinary aristocracy deferring to more war-minded marshals. By "
"tradition, in both Wesmere and Lintanir, an enchantress from the order of "
"elven mystics is also called upon to facilitate the transition of power."

"\n"
"Whatever their origin, the Dunefolk have thrived. Bustling cities stand "

"designated to protect the superior interest of the nation.\n"

"Those who have not settled in these urban centers still adhere to the "
"lifestyle of their ancestors, roaming the dunes and leading their herds from "
"one watering hole to another. They are most active during the early hours of "
"dawn and the onset of dusk, when the wastelands are neither too hot nor too "

"standards. Although sometimes regarded with contempt by their city "
"counterparts, they provide an invaluable service as mobile, light troops in "
"war, or as escorts for trading caravans during times of peace.\n"
"\n"
"The Dunefolk’s inclination towards trade and exploration has allowed their "
"cities to amass immense fortunes, a fact regarded both with admiration and "
"envy by other races. Mutual interests have fostered cordial relations with "
"neighboring Naga tribes, but more secretive races such as Drakes and Elves "
"have always considered Dunefolk expeditions to be too intrusive, especially "
"when they venture close to territorial boundaries. It is not uncommon for "
"caravans to fall prey to troll ambushes in the mountains, something that has "
"given rise to countless tales of unimaginable treasure amassed in hidden "
"caves.\n"
"\n"
"As a result of living in hostile environments for centuries, the Dunefolk "
"have developed rational methods of enquiry through which they continue to "
"improve their understanding of the world. Their study of herbal medicine "
"keeps their warriors and workers fresh and healthy. Their knowledge of "
"alchemy allows them to tame fire and wield it as a deadly weapon in battle. "
"At the same time, this analytical mindset has distanced them from magical "
"arts; to the rational mind, magic is uncontrollable, unpredictable, and "
"hence unreliable. For this reason, the Dunefolk especially loathe the "
"perversions of necromancy and the dark arts, even more so than other races.\n"
"\n"
"The Dunefolk’s inquisitive and explorative nature does not preclude military "
"strength. Not only do they field nimble light troops, cataphracts, and "
"heavily armored infantry, but their keen knowledge of technology grants them "
"a decisive advantage over their opponents. When facing the Dunefolk in "
"battle, however, the most fearsome sight is certainly their deployment of "
"ferocious and bizarre beasts. From the majestic Roc to the imposing Wyvern, "
"their synergy with these creatures allows for great versatility in combat. "

"New Saurian clans are started when the proper astrological signs are read. "
"Called a “hatching,” each female indicated by the conjunction selects a "
"group of individuals with lower rank and leave their source clan. Frequently "
"all females with a specific trait will be indicated, causing multiple clans "
"to “hatch” at the same time. Selection is a simple process: no group leaving "
"can be larger than any other, all the groups together cannot be larger than "
"the group being left, and higher ranking allows a female to overrule another "
"female's choice of who they take.\n"
"\n"
"Because of their rapid population growth, frequent splits in clans, and the "
"fact that cannibalism is not taboo, violence is one of the defining features "
"of Saurian life. This limits the growth of the Saurian culture to fits and "
"starts, as much of their knowledge is passed by oral tradition and their "
"possessions must be mobile.\n"

"Saurians live spectacularly short lives by comparison to most of the other "
"races of Wesnoth, reaching full adulthood within three years and often dying "
"by the time they are 10 to 15 years old. By far, the most common cause of "
"death is violence. Saurian females produce clutches of about 20 eggs roughly "
"once a year, which creates constant population pressure and would stress "
"most carnivores' food supply. Hunters and scavengers, Saurians have "
"extremely strong jaws and have a very powerful digestive system with highly "
"acidic fluids, making them capable of eating and digesting all of their prey "
"including skin, teeth, horns and bones. Further, they have no aversion to "
"eating carrion and even committing cannibalism, which are both regular "
"occurrences."

"\n"
"Orc societies are based on little else but strength; might makes right, and "

"Orcs mostly live in rural areas, often in foothills or mountainous regions, "

"They are also somewhat curious of their surroundings and many younger whelps "

"group of trolls that by joining them they get to exact revenge on those that "

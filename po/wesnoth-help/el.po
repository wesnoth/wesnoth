"Over the River Aethen, south of Fort Tahn, is a Wesnothian frontier region. "

"Clans; the best horses in Wesnoth are bred here.\n"
"          ◦ Estmark Hills: Largish range rising south of the Great River and "

"Weldyn, has at various times been settled by Wesnothians, but the Kingdom's "
"control is tenuous at best and banditry is common.\n"

"Drakes are large, winged and fire-breathing creatures, reminiscent of true "
"dragons. On average, an adult drake stands around three meters tall and "
"easily weighs more than a man and a horse combined. Their skin is made up of "
"hard scales, resistant to most physical strikes except piercing and cold "
"damage. Most drakes are capable of true flight and can travel long distances "
"quickly. However, their sheer weight and bulk limits their flight ability "
"somewhat, making them ungainly in the air. Where possible, they make use of "
"terrain features such as hills, mountains and trees as launch points in "
"order to gain greater height and speed. Fortunately for their enemies, they "
"are still quite clumsy creatures and surprisingly slow in combat. This, "
"combined with their large size, renders them easy targets for those who dare "
"attack them.\n"
"\n"
"Drakes are inherently magical creatures, with a mysterious internal fire "
"fueling their very lives. This can easily be witnessed when one of their "
"kind perishes in combat; its internal fire is released, burning their "
"remains in to ashes. Their internal fire is also their greatest weakness; it "
"makes them extremely vulnerable to cold attacks. Despite their magical "
"nature, drakes are incapable of channeling magic in a controlled manner. "
"While the magic imbued within a drake’s body enables it to spit fire and "
"gives it life, they have no willful control over the functions of this "
"magic.\n"
"\n"
"<header>text='Society'</header>\n"
"Drakes are a relatively warlike race and their societies can be best "
"described as cultured martial societies. The core of a drake tribe is a "
"small group of veteran warriors headed by a mutually respected — or simply "
"feared — dominant who rules the society with an iron fist. Every drake is "
"expected to earn their place in the strict hierarchy, to obey their "
"superiors and command their inferiors. Entry to the ruling elite is only "
"possible through challenging and defeating a superior in single combat, "
"which is the way the hierarchy within the elite itself is established. The "
"use of deception of any kind towards any fellow drake is, without exception, "
"seen as cowardly and unacceptable.\n"
"\n"
"While their warlike nature and sense of territory drives them to defend "
"their territories savagely, drakes rarely invade or trespass on areas "
"already occupied by the other major races. Instead, they settle in "
"unpopulated areas to establish their own territory there. They primarily "
"feed on large game they hunt in the lowlands around their homes, but "
"hatchlings and lower caste drakes are known to feed also on certain kinds of "
"moss and fungi they cultivate deep in their caverns. The only technology "
"drakes value is armor- and weapon-smithing, and neither know or need other "
"science and culture besides this. However, the few implements they do "
"fashion are almost unrivaled in quality, only matched by those produced in "
"the finest Dwarvish foundries.\n"
"\n"
"Drakes hatch from eggs and usually live naturally between 20 to 30 years. "
"Death in battle is the most preferred way for a drake to leave this world. "
"Unlike the elder members of other races, drakes naturally grow more "
"aggressive and reckless towards the ends of their natural lives, perhaps to "
"help ensure their place in the heroic legends of their kind.\n"

"Drakes originated from an archipelago of volcanic islands called "

"The dwarves are a race famed for their miners, blacksmiths, merchants and "

"tell of a time long forgotten when their people began emerging from their "
"underground world through caves. Nothing is known about their life prior to "
"their arrival, or their reasons for entering the surface world, but they "
"have been an integral part of the history of the continent since. Soon after "
"their emergence from the underground, the dwarves entered into conflict with "
"the original inhabitants of the land, the elves. The original reason for "
"their dispute has been lost to history, but the two races have since fought "
"three long wars, interrupted by a few decades of peace. During these wars "
"the dwarves could not dislodge the elves from the deep forests in the south, "
"but managed to consolidate their position in hills and the mountains in the "
"north of the continent, known now as the Northlands. Since then they have "
"constructed fantastic fortifications and settlements deep within the "
"mountains and crags of their territory.\n"
"\n"
"Possibly due to their isolation, the dwarves are generally distrustful or "
"hostile towards most other races, particularly the elves. The single "
"exception to this temperament is towards humans. This could be traced back "
"to the era of Haldric I and the arrival of humans and orcs to the continent. "
"At this point the dwarves began allowing some humans, mostly dissidents and "
"outlaws from the Kingdom of Wesnoth, to settle in certain areas of the "
"Northlands. Their motivation was unsurprising. The plight of these "
"individuals reminded the dwarves of their early history of persecution, "
"eliciting a sense of solidarity. The dwarves also had much to gain in "
"forming a bond with these outcasts. They would settle in areas where dwarves "
"disliked living themselves; plains, forests, and swamps, freeing them from "
"defending these areas.\n"

"of their most famous, and feared, discoveries was a mysterious powder that "
"produces an immense explosion when exposed to fire or sparks. Certain dwarf "
"warriors use this powder to hurl small objects at tremendous speeds. Given "

"Trolls are ancient creatures, one of the oldest known races known to inhabit "
"the Great Continent. They are large, slow, simple-minded, and live extremely "
"long lives inside deep caves or atop high mountains. The most unique "
"characteristic of trolls is an internal vitality that sustains and heals "
"them from within. As a result they live very different lives from almost any "
"known creature. Trolls have few real needs: they require little food or "
"water, and thus they have little incentive to pursue much besides protection "
"from those who are hostile towards them. This in turn means they rarely have "
"to worry about anything and can spend much of their time sleeping or in "
"contemplation. Trolls have a curious affinity with nature. They do not "
"relate with living things like elves do, but instead with earth and stone. "
"They are also somewhat curious of their surroundings and many younger whelps "
"even enjoy traveling and seeing the world. As trolls grow older they tend to "
"become increasingly passive, gradually losing interest in their environment "
"and spending more of their time sleeping in a quiet, familiar corner of "
"their home cave. This is until they finally pass away as their bodies "
"themselves slowly turn into lifeless statues of stone.\n"
"\n"
"Trolls are seen by many as being little more than yet another race of savage "
"monsters. This common misconception is in part perpetuated by orcs to "
"persuade trolls to join their armies. Because they are rather simple and do "
"not understand the ways of other races or sometimes cannot even tell them "
"apart, it is usually easy for an orcish band to convince a group of trolls "
"that by joining them they get to exact revenge on those that have before "
"hunted them. These new recruits are then directed to attack whoever the orcs "
"themselves are currently in conflict with, whether previously a foe of the "
"trolls or not, accumulating even more enemies for the misled trolls. The "
"most common enemy of trolls are dwarves, and the animosity between these two "
"races is ancient.\n"

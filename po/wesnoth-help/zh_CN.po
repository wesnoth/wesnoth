"The dwarves are a race famed for their miners, blacksmiths, merchants and "
"warriors. Considered as the third oldest race on the great continent after "
"the elves and trolls, their early history is shrouded in mystery. Legends "
"tell of a time long forgotten when their people began emerging from their "
"underground world through caves. Nothing is known about their life prior to "
"their arrival, or their reasons for entering the surface world, but they "
"have been an integral part of the history of the continent since. Soon after "
"their emergence from the underground, the dwarves entered into conflict with "
"the original inhabitants of the land, the elves. The original reason for "
"their dispute has been lost to history, but the two races have since fought "
"three long wars, interrupted by a few decades of peace. During these wars "
"the dwarves could not dislodge the elves from the deep forests in the south, "
"but managed to consolidate their position in hills and the mountains in the "
"north of the continent, known now as the Northlands. Since then they have "
"constructed fantastic fortifications and settlements deep within the "
"mountains and crags of their territory.\n"
"\n"
"Possibly due to their isolation, the dwarves are generally distrustful or "
"hostile towards most other races, particularly the elves. The single "
"exception to this temperament is towards humans. This could be traced back "
"to the era of Haldric I and the arrival of humans and orcs to the continent. "
"At this point the dwarves began allowing some humans, mostly dissidents and "
"outlaws from the Kingdom of Wesnoth, to settle in certain areas of the "
"Northlands. Their motivation was unsurprising. The plight of these "
"individuals reminded the dwarves of their early history of persecution, "
"eliciting a sense of solidarity. The dwarves also had much to gain in "
"forming a bond with these outcasts. They would settle in areas where dwarves "
"disliked living themselves; plains, forests, and swamps, freeing them from "
"defending these areas.\n"
"\n"
"Dwarves are of small stature by human measure, but they are by no means "
"fragile. Their warriors, tough and powerful are both feared and respected "

"Trolls are ancient creatures, one of the oldest known races known to inhabit "
"the Great Continent. They are large, slow, simple-minded, and live extremely "
"long lives inside deep caves or atop high mountains. The most unique "
"characteristic of trolls is an internal vitality that sustains and heals "
"them from within. As a result they live very different lives from almost any "
"known creature. Trolls have few real needs: they require little food or "
"water, and thus they have little incentive to pursue much besides protection "
"from those who are hostile towards them. This in turn means they rarely have "
"to worry about anything and can spend much of their time sleeping or in "
"contemplation. Trolls have a curious affinity with nature. They do not "
"relate with living things like elves do, but instead with earth and stone. "
"They are also somewhat curious of their surroundings and many younger whelps "
"even enjoy traveling and seeing the world. As trolls grow older they tend to "
"become increasingly passive, gradually losing interest in their environment "
"and spending more of their time sleeping in a quiet, familiar corner of "
"their home cave. This is until they finally pass away as their bodies "
"themselves slowly turn into lifeless statues of stone.\n"
"\n"
"Trolls are seen by many as being little more than yet another race of savage "
"monsters. This common misconception is in part perpetuated by orcs to "
"persuade trolls to join their armies. Because they are rather simple and do "
"not understand the ways of other races or sometimes can even tell them "
"apart, it is usually easy for an orcish band to convince a group of trolls "
"that by joining them they get to exact revenge on those that have before "
"hunted them. These new recruits are then directed to attack whoever the orcs "
"themselves are currently in conflict with, whether previously a foe of the "
"trolls or not, accumulating even more enemies for the misled trolls. The "

"As the lich’s final death scream echoed across the battlefield, his skeletal "
"form began to crumble. Decayed bones disintegrated into ash, borne away on "
"the frigid wind, another immortal soul cast back into the endless flow of "
"time. With their master’s power gone, the undead warriors fell back to "
"lifelessness, crumbling into inanimate heaps of bones. The wind flowed "
"across the battlefield in gentle streams, carrying with it the souls of the "
"fallen and ascending toward the sky where the sun began to break through the "
"ashen clouds. As the sunlight broke through, the wind subsided, and all was "
"still."

"For several days, the healers of Westin worked feverishly to save as many of "

"After the battle, Deoran led an expedition to the southern border posts, "
"where the forts had been smashed into crumbled ruins, and blood and broken "
"weapons were scattered all about. He silently cursed the lich for the lack "
"of bodies at the site of the battle, but deep down, he had known that that "
"would be the fate of the men who had valiantly given their lives so that "
"Westin might survive the undead onslaught. Still, he found small consolation "
"in locating Sir Gerrick’s glaive and shield and bearing them back with him "
"to Westin. Those he placed atop Gerrick’s mound, where they became a symbol "
"of sacrifice, and loyalty, and valor."

"Urza Afalas earned his own mound as well, a small, inconspicuous thing near "
"his old home, where his brothers and he used to live before they were exiled "
"for their crimes. Knowing that the former outlaw leader had helped defend "
"the city against the undead assault, the Council of Westin absolved the "
"remaining bandits of their crimes and allowed them to return to their homes. "
"After many years away from home and a difficult and terrifying battle "
"against the undead, most were more than happy to come back in peace and help "
"clean up the town."

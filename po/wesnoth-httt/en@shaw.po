"The Sceptre of Fire is the most ancient artifact of the realm of Wesnoth. It "
"was forged by the dwarves of Knalga at the request of King Haldric II. It "
"took their finest smiths years to make it, but soon after it was completed, "
"the makers were chased underground, attacked by the elves. None know exactly "
"what occurred, but the Sceptre was lost somewhere in the great caverns. "
"Years have passed, and the fortunes of the dwarves have waxed and waned, but "
"the Sceptre has never been found."

"Legend says that that little river comes from the land of the North Elves. "
"It is said that it is an outflow of Everlore, which flows in the land of my "

"entrances and springs which flow into the ground. I can say no more about "
"it, except that it is swarming with undead and other creatures which find "
"power in the darkness of the caves. We elves prefer not to venture into the "

"foolish enough to wander outside. No elves have been inside for centuries "

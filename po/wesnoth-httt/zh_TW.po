#. Haralamdum is ancient, and his mind does not work well any more. He takes things very slowly and carefully, even for a Wose. He halts and pauses, often searching for something in his memory, using meaningless syllables to fill the gap. The syllables of his name come from the phrase he uses to mean "that is all" or "I am done" which he says often, usually out of frustration with how hasty everyone seems. Nobody alive knows his real name, and he has likely forgotten as well. Feel free to add, move, or remove pauses to break up, or even scatter, his train of thought. For inspiration, think of Asperger Syndrome.

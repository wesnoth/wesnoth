# I have translated Wesnoth into two chinese characters counting from the last four characters.
# Wesnoth = mid(TranslatedString, 9,2)
# As there are no direct Chinese word for it, I go for the sound.
# Using "Wei" as the Hanyu Pinying, I choose this one out of probably more than fifty characters.
# The primary reason is, to Chinese people, "Wei" was once a great state during the era of the Chinese warlords.
# (The well known book: Romance Of The Three Kindom Classic wrote of this history.)
# Hence, this word "Wei" conveys to the Chinese memories of war, strategies, betrayal, victories and defeat.
# The word "nuo" chosen can and has been be used in names. Hence I combine these two characters to describe game Wesnoth, one of war, strategy, victories and defeat.

"Succession among the Elvish nobility is a highly structured process "

"society: warriors and rangers who defend the forests, peaceable civilians "

"mystics who study the art of faerie magic. Being able to reconcile the "
"differences between these factions and effectively lead their people "
"requires considerable personal merit and a deep understanding of all elves, "
"be they warrior, mystic, or pacifist.\n"
"\n"
"Many elves begin training in archery and swordsmanship from a young age, and "
"especially promising adolescent boys of appropriate lineage are selected to "
"study under Enchantresses who have mastered the mystic arts. Since the "
"nature of faerie magic lends itself more to female elves than to male elves, "
"only the most talented learn to temper the volatile way of the faerie and "
"connect themselves to the world of the arcane. Those who prove their "
"personal mettle in swordsmanship and sorcery must then learn to apply their "
"newfound powers wisely, for violent conflict is something never to be taken "
"lightly, and just because a battle can be won does not mean it should be "
"fought in the first place. Reconciling potent combat prowess with diplomatic "

"The prevalence of guerrilla tactics in Elven strategy results in great "
"emphasis on maintaining highly mobile units capable of fighting on an "
"adaptable battlefront. This style of warfare requires rapid communication "
"between small skirmish groups and the ability to quickly transfer troops "
"between combat zones. Experienced Elvish riders know this well and thus "
"devote most of their time to improving their horsemanship rather than their "
"individual fighting skills. The speed at which they travel through the "
"forest would be suicidal for any other cavalry, and they are tenacious "
"enough to ride for as much as two or three days at a time without resting. "
"While the intelligence and communication these horsemen provide is "
"invaluable to Elven tactics, the lack of combat prowess and front line "
"engagement means that Elvish riders are the oft unsung heroes of war, left "
"supporting their brethren from the back lines."

"Although the equines bred by the wood elves are much faster and far more "

"It takes many years to train an Elven pony, but once tamed, they are among "
"the most loyal and devoted mounts. These unique horses allow Elvish horsemen "
"to ride at extreme speeds through thick forests with nary a scratch and "
"outpace most other cavalry on open ground. Though these riders possess some "
"skill in wielding swords and bows, their greatest effectiveness comes from "
"their ability to scout and outmaneuver enemy forces rather than engage in "
"combat directly. Elvish scouts are most often used as messengers and support "
"units and are adept at quickly transferring information between patrols and "

"A halberd is a heavy weapon and difficult to use, but very powerful in the "
"hands of an expert. It is also much more flexible than the spear from which "
"it descended. As any halberdier can tell you, the weapon possesses four "
"primary striking points, two more than a spear or pike; these are the tip, "
"the blade, the spike at the base of the shaft, and the inner point on the "
"blade, which can be used in a motion pulling back towards the wielder. All "
"this makes for a very versatile weapon in melee, especially against "
"cavalry.\n"
"\n"
"However, a halberd is notably more expensive to craft than a spear, and in "
"the hands of a novice, much less effective. In the armies of Wesnoth, it is "
"customary only to grant these weapons to veteran pikemen, who have proven "
"that they have the skill to employ them properly on the field of war."

"The title of Arch Mage is traditionally conferred only after a lifetime of "

"their wisdom. Many tend to wealthy patrons, a profitable enterprise for both "
"as, outside of the occasional thaumaturgy or word of advice, it gives the "

"Upon the successful culmination of their apprenticeship, a mage is stripped "
"of the brown robes of an apprentice and given the ruddy cloak of a master. "
"The significance of this change is often lost on the peasantry, who "
"mistakenly title Master Magi as ‘Red Magi’. Likewise, the symbolism of the "
"change in colors is often mistaken to signify the mage’s ability to "
"seemingly conjure fire from nothing but thin air, a trick which, although "
"undeniably useful, is viewed by the magi themselves as a crass application "
"of their hard-won knowledge.\n"
"\n"
"Though physically frail, and untrained as warriors, the ‘Red Magi’ have a "
"number of tricks up their sleeves, including the gouts of fire which may "
"have cemented their colloquial name."

"The many paths that a mage can take in study lead to strikingly different "
"ends. Often viewed as sages, or wandering mystics, silver magi act under an "
"agenda which is obscure even to their own colleagues. Though helpful to the "
"magisteriums which often employ them in the field, they remain somewhat "
"aloof.\n"
"\n"
"They have, in fact, their own order amongst the ranks of magi, an order "
"which withholds certain secrets from their peers. One of these is an "
"apparent ability to cross great distances, faster than one could possibly "
"travel on foot. Members of the silver order ardently refuse to discuss the "
"workings of this with any of their fellow magi, and on those rare occasions "
"when others have pried into their work, they have abandoned the endeavor, "
"never to speak of it again.\n"
"\n"
"Silver magi are often more physically adept than other magi, and their "
"skills are of undeniable use on the battlefield, if one can manage to induce "
"the mage to apply them."

"Little is known about Yetis, ape-like creatures said to live in remote and "
"snow-covered mountains. Few profess to have seen one, and their existence is "
"doubted by many. Most accounts agree on several factors though — while slow "
"and simple-minded, yetis are extremely resilient, and can kill any they "
"encounter with their bare fists. This is enough to keep even the doubtful "
"from venturing too far onto the mountains they are said to inhabit."

"The dread inspired by black magic comes chiefly from how little is known "
"about it by the common man. Dark sorceresses have begun to unlock the "
"secrets of life and death, the latter of which is all too easy to inflict. "
"This labor gives the first glimmerings of the connection between the soul "
"and inert matter, and the first successful experiments in manipulating this "
"bond. The terrible unknown that lurks beyond death is glimpsed, and will "
"inevitably be fathomed.\n"
"\n"
"Despite any design they may have of using this to wrest their own "
"immortality from nature’s grasp, the first results of their work have "
"immediate, and unpleasant applications. The life they breathe into dead "
"matter can create servants for them, servants which will work, but which "
"will also kill, and will never question their mistress. These creations have "
"a loyalty any tyrant would dream of, and it is tempting to those with even "
"the merest desire for power."

"The Southern Naga commonly recount a curious story about the Wind Spirit, "
"Zefra and the aetherial chakram:\n"
"\n"
"In the distant past, there was a chakram wielder who was possessed of "
"legendary skill. It is said that he could cleave the very seas with a flurry "
"of blades, fell a hundred foes before a single could reach him, and deflect "
"a thousand arrows without being struck. Called by the name of Xylrix, "
"tempest, he was a warrior whose arrogance was as great as his talent. He was "
"always more than willing to boast his prowess to any and all who would watch "
"him. Then one day, while flaunting himself to a band of young Nagini, he "
"chose a sacred Allnai tree as his target.\n"
"\n"
"‘Watch,’ he bellowed, and split the tree straight in two.\n"
"\n"
"In that moment, a great wind surrounded him and the Wind Spirit’s voice "
"echoed in his ears, ‘You think yourself mighty for slaying my hapless "
"offspring? Though talent you possess, no mortal should trifle with the "
"divinity that guides them.’\n"
"\n"
"He retorted, ‘Come, spirit. I am not afraid. No weapon, steel, water, or "
"wind, shall stand up to my rings.’\n"
"\n"
"The wind whirled ever faster, a torrent of gale force spiraling and "
"spiraling in a gyrating dance of fury. He felt himself lifted from the "
"ground, spinning at a tremendous rate, rendered utterly hapless at the mercy "
"of Zefra’s wrath. Face upturned in terror, he let go of his blades and "
"suddenly saw it in the whirling tempest—the twirling motion of the ringed "
"chakrams, patterned in the very wind itself.\n"
"\n"
"As quickly as the storm came, it vanished, leaving Xylrix to contemplate his "
"broken weapons. When he finally returned to his home many days later, he "
"announced his new name: Zephyr, a warrior who serves the Wind on which his "
"blades fly.\n"
"\n"

"可以在在一個敵人摸到他之前擊倒一百個敵人，還可以偏轉一千支箭矢而不會被擊中。"

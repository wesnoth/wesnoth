"There is a curious story of a farmer who had a great oak in his lawn, a tree "
"which had stood when his father first broke the soil on that land, and under "
"which his family had many memories. It was thus a shock to him, one morning, "
"when he awoke to find it somehow spirited away, with nothing but a bare "
"patch of earth where it once stood.\n"
"\n"
"Such encounters are all that is known of what are presumably the most "
"ancient of woses.\n"

"Woses have been said to possess many shapes, all of them tree-like in form, "
"and as they age, to increase in size. Tales tell of woses who resemble trees "
"in this respect as well, towering over the creatures who walk beneath them. "
"This is the greater part of why they are so rarely seen - standing in the "
"slumber which they so often do, a wose of that stature appears to be nothing "
"more than an oddly-shaped tree. Even a careless elf can sometimes be "
"fooled.\n"
"\n"
"Woses are not warriors by any means, but their great strength can easily be "
"turned to violence, should someone manage to raise the ire of these "
"creatures.\n"

"Rarely seen even by elves, the Wose is an order of creature about which "
"little is known. The elves are the source of most of this knowledge; they "
"know that these beings are not descended from trees, despite the similarity "
"in form, and they know that a wose is more closely tied to the faerie world "
"than the elves themselves, though in a different way. The motives and "
"workings of their kind are unknown, though most subscribe to the obvious "
"theory that woses are dedicated wardens of the natural world.\n"
"\n"
"Woses are utterly unwarlike, but possess a great strength. They are, "
"however, neither used to, nor quick at moving around.\n"

"A halberd is a heavy weapon and difficult to use, but very powerful in the "
"hands of an expert. It is also much more flexible than the spear from which "
"it descended. As any halberdier can tell you, the weapon possesses four "
"primary striking points, two more than a spear or pike; these are the tip, "
"the blade, the spike at the base of the shaft, and the inner point on the "
"blade, which can be used in a motion pulling back towards the wielder. All "
"this makes for a very versatile weapon in melee, especially against "
"cavalry.\n"

"However, a halberd is notably more expensive to craft than a spear, and in "

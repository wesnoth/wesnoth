"Woses have been said to possess many shapes, all of them tree-like in form, "
"and as they age, to increase in size. Tales tell of woses who resemble trees "
"in this respect as well, towering over the creatures who walk beneath them. "
"This is the greater part of why they are so rarely seen - standing in the "
"slumber which they so often do, a wose of that stature appears to be nothing "
"more than an oddly-shaped tree. Even a careless elf can sometimes be "
"fooled.\n"
"\n"
"Woses are not warriors by any means, but their great strength can easily be "
"turned to violence, should someone manage to raise the ire of these "
"creatures.\n"

"in form, and they know that a wose is more closely tied to the faerie world "

"It is not clear why the Dragonguards are called what they are, a name given "
"by their dwarven brethren. Some speculate that the name comes from their "
"weapon of choice, these strange staves that belch fire and death. Others "
"have surmised that it is because such weapons would be a threat against even "
"a true Dragon, should such a thing be seen again in the known world. "
"Whatever the case, it is for these weapons that the guardians of the great "
"Dwarven citadels are both renowned and feared; weapons that have broken the "
"mightiest of warriors with a single blow."

"猜想，这是由于这种武器甚至对真正的龙都能构成威胁，如果在已知的世界中能再一次"
"见到这样的东西的话。无论如何，正是这些武器使得矮人族伟大堡垒的守卫者们闻名于"
"世，并且令人畏惧——这是些能将最强悍的勇士一击必杀的武器。"

"It is not clear why the Dragonguards are called what they are, a name given "
"by their dwarven brethren. Some speculate that the name comes from their "
"weapon of choice, these strange staves that belch fire and death. Others "
"have surmised that it is because such weapons would be a threat against even "
"a true Dragon, should such a thing be seen again in the known world. "
"Whatever the case, it is for these weapons that the guardians of the great "
"Dwarven citadels are both renowned and feared; weapons that have broken the "
"mightiest of warriors with a single blow."

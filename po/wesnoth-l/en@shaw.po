"From the Annals of Alduin, 98 YW\n"
"\n"
"One score and eight years ago, in 70 YW, the King of Wesnoth and the Lord of "
"Elensefar signed a treaty of trade and alliance in order to further the "
"security of humankind. The realization of this treaty required the creation "
"of a safe path between Weldyn and Elensefar, with all manner of hostile "
"creature or beast scoured from these civilized lands. From Dan’Tonk, the "
"establishment of Aldril and Carcyn secured the once hazardous passage "
"alongside the Grey Woods, completing the way between the two cities. With "
"this, the alliance can truly be deemed a coalition of men."

"To commemorate the concordat, six years ago, the Lords of Weldyn and "
"Elensefar decreed that a monument be erected in the heart of these once "
"wildlands. We, the magi of Alduin, lent our services to demonstrate the full "
"prowess and might of human magic. Above a series of old catacombs in a scant "
"hill, we spent these years raising an immense stronghold from the earth’s "
"living rock."

"Completed, as it is on this day, this sentinel of the west now towers "
"hundreds of paces tall, a great monolith looming sheer above the plains. The "
"sight of these colossal walls, to even us magi, is both awe-inspiring and "
"terrifying. So tall these towers peak and so mighty these walls arise that "
"such a feat seems more like a force of nature than a work of man. That we "
"have fashioned this mountain as insignificant humans is almost "
"inconceivable. Halstead, as we have named it, is impenetrable. No one shall "
"ever overcome these tidal waves of stone."

"From the Annals of Alduin, 98 YW\n"
"\n"
"One score and eight years ago, in 70 YW, the King of Wesnoth and the Lord of "
"Elensefar signed a treaty of trade and alliance in order to further the "
"security of humankind. The realization of this treaty required the creation "
"of a safe path between Weldyn and Elensefar, with all manner of hostile "
"creature or beast scoured from these civilized lands. From Dan’Tonk, the "
"establishment of Aldril and Carcyn secured the once hazardous passage "
"alongside the Grey Woods, completing the way between the two cities. With "
"this, the alliance can truly be deemed a coalition of men."

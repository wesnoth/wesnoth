This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please
take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That
is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using
 complete sentences, not just single words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

***

This release is the first 1.6 release candidate, meaning that no further 
compatibility-breaking changes are expected. We invite all content-providers,
Wesnoth-related external sites, and any other concerned parties to test compatibility 
with this release. We also encourage players to playtest this release heavily.
Now is the time to report all the bugs that are obvious to you but which we 
may not have noticed.

***

The message dialog got overhauled with some new images.  These are placeholders.
They will be polished prior to releasing 1.6.

This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please
take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That
is making sure that spelling/grammer/whatever is usable and that you are using
 complete sentences, not just single words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

*** 1.5.6+svn ***
***

Some bugs related to replays have been fixed. The
reset-to-beginning button no longer causes a crash,
and single-player campaign scenario replays should
work again.

***

Compressed start of scenario saves are recognized
again by the load-game dialog.

***

The game now has two ingame dialogs, the old one and a new one. The new one
shows a transparent portait which will be scaled to fit nicely on the screen.
This might need some tuning. This means all portraits made by Kitty and the new
portraits of LordBob can now be shown in their full glory.
(Note the WML part of it is not documented since the API is not stable yet,
this will be done before 1.6.)

Note this feature is still a bit experimental and some custom unit portraits no
longer are shown. This will be fixed before 1.6 as well.

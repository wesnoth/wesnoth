This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes
here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to
the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever
is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single
words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

We've had several reports of problems with SDL 1.2.14, for now we advice to
stick with SDL 1.2.13.

***

Thanks to the testers of the new lobby we got several reports about problems in
the lobby. Many of those problems have been fixed, the others are still worked
upon. 

***

There's a regression that some dialogs are larger as in beta 1, this is fixed
in the development version.

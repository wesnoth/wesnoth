This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release,
it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

just dump whatever you want to have mentionned in the release notes here.

The release team can empty this file after each Release..



Boucman:
The old [animation] in [attack] that was used to describe attack animations has been deprecated...
you can now use an [attack_anim] block within the [unit] block... 
this means that attack animations work in a similar fashion to all other anims, and should be easier to edit/add via WML

a new apply_to=new_animation was added to WML to easily add animations to units

This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please
take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That
is making sure that spelling/grammer/whatever is usable and that you are using
 complete sentences, not just single words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

- Pressing escape in a new dialog, behaves like in the old dialogs again.
- Fixed several glitches in with the listboxes and new portrait dialog.

Improvements of the multiplayer ui:
- Added a gui front-end to various commands, brought up by double clicking
  a player name, replacing the old whisper dialog

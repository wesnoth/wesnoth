This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

CHANGES
=======

[rasection="Example section title"]
Example contents.
[/rasection]

[rasection="WML/Lua compatibility changes and deprecations"]
[list]
[*]wesnoth.set/get_dialog_value now takes/returns an integer (0 or 1) instead of a boolean for toggelbuttons and toggelpanels. The reason is that wesnoth now also supports tristate buttons and comboboxes where it can returns values other than 0 or 1.
[/list]
[/rasection]

[rasection="SDL2 support"]
The game now uses SDL2 for all operations. There is still a fall-back option of using SDL 1.2, but it is deprecated and slated for removal. 
[/rasection]

[rasection="Hotkeys rely on scancodes"]
The hotkey implementation has been changed to rely on scancodes over characters. This means that the hotkey configuration now uses the same physical buttons on the keyboard, regardless of the keyboard layout.
[/rasection]

[rasection="New WML event"]
A new 'unit placed' event has been added, making it possible to better implement certain kinds of event-driven behavior. [wiki=EventWML]See the wiki for details[/wiki].

KNOWN BUGS
==========

[raissue="Newly introduced in 1.13.x"]
[b]General bugs:[/b]

[list]
[*]The MP server has trouble with Local player types in campaigns (bug [bug]21965[/bug]). We have decided to postpone dealing with this. In the meantime, you might try assigning such sides to the host, or running multiple instances of Wesnoth.
[*]2p mp survival map Dark Forecast is bugged (24200).
[/list]
[*]Doubled-up GUI1 dialogs don't redraw the secondary in SDL2 (bug [bug]24294[/bug]).
[*]Window state handling inconsistent across different OSes in SDL2 builds (bug [bug]24270[/bug]).
[*]Area under Objectives not redrawn on resize (bug [bug]24261[/bug]).
[*]Menu and Action buttons disappear on resize (bug [bug]24260[/bug]).
[*]Wesnoth does not exist on the panel (bug [bug]24202[/bug]).
[*]SDL2 build handled input incorrectly once window focus is lost when menus are open (bug [bug]24212[/bug]).
[/raissue]

[raissue="Carried over from 1.12.x"]
[b]General bugs:[/b]

[list]
[*]The game can crash when planning recruits in Planning Mode.
[*]It’s not possible to clear some default hotkeys with the Clear Hotkey option (bug [bug]21983[/bug]).
[*]Attempting to assign hotkeys including both the Ctrl and Alt modifiers does not work (bug [bug]22219[/bug]).
[/list]

[b]Bugs specific to Microsoft Windows:[/b]

[list]
[*]ClearType font rendering is disabled as it causes glitches (bug [bug]21648[/bug]).
This is likely caused by outdated libraries in the packaging process.
[*]Consecutive line breaks (paragraph breaks) are not rendered as expected (bug [bug]21649[/bug]).
This is likely caused by outdated libraries in the packaging process. There is no built-in workaround available yet.
[/list]

[b]Bugs specific to Apple OS X:[/b]

The following issues affecting Wesnoth on Apple OS X are known and they are pending fixes. Many of them require significant re-engineering that can only be done in 1.13.x development releases later, or cannot be properly addressed due to a lack of experienced OS X coders in our team. Thus, unless someone can contribute patches to address them, it is unlikely that these bugs will be fixed.

[list]
[*]The default variable-width font is used instead of a monospace font even where a monospace font is required (bug [bug]23628[/bug]).
[*]Helvetica is used as the default variable-width font instead of DejaVu Sans (bug [bug]23560[/bug]).
[*]Fullscreen mode does not fill the entire screen when maximum resolution is selected in Preferences → Display, and user interface elements are scaled and distorted.
[*]System commands do not work while Wesnoth is running in fullscreen mode (bug [bug]21943[/bug]).
[*]Trackpad tap clicking is sometimes not recognized ([url=http://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=39788]forum post[/url]).
[*]Unofficial builds  with OpenMP support enabled randomly freeze (bug [bug]18144[/bug]).
[*]Consecutive line breaks (paragraph breaks) are not rendered as expected (bug [bug]21649[/bug]).
This is likely caused by outdated libraries in the packaging process. There is no built-in workaround available yet.

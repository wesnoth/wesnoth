Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

[section="New Micro AI functionality and [micro_ai] tag"]
18 new specialized and configurable AIs, so-called Micro AIs, are now available together with 14 test scenarios.  Mirco AIs allow Wesnoth campaign and scenario authors to add new AI functionality without the need for any AI programming. A Micro AI is activated and configured (or deleted) simply via the [micro_ai] tag, requiring only a few lines of WML code.

This includes AIs for 7 different animal behaviors, bottleneck defense, 2 different guardians and a coward, healer support, lurkers, messenger escort, patrol, protect and move a unit, and 2 alternative recruiting strategies.

Full documentation is available [wiki=Micro_AIs]on the Wesnoth wiki[/wiki], which explains what the different Micro AIs do, how to set them up and configure them, and how to start the test scenarios.

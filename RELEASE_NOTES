This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please
take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That
is making sure that spelling/grammer/whatever is usable and that you are using
 complete sentences, not just single words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

From this version onward, the developement team will only focus on bug-fixing. The WML API will probably have very little changes.

Thus, now is a good time to port all User Made Content to 1.5


***
The image path functions (~RC(), ~TC(), ~FL() et al) parsing has been heavily
modified. Now all functions in a path are stacked in a left-to-right order, with
the sole exceptions of ~RC() and ~TC(), which continue to be non-accumulable.

Additionally, a new note-worthy image path function, ~SCALE(width,height), was
introduced; it scales graphics, of course.

***

The conversion of the old message dialogs to the new message dialogs is mostly
complete. The code needs some more polishing. WML authors who use advanced
features of the [message] tag are encouraged to test their addons with the new
engine and report bugs if they find them.

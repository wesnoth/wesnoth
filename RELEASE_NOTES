This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes
here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to
the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever
is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single
words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

***

A new campaign has entered mainline after being hosted by the
Wesnoth-UMC-Dev Project for a few months. It is Dead Water, an
intermediate level merfolk campaign with 13 scenarios.

***

On X11 systems, Battle for Wesnoth now respects the XDG base directory
specification when storing files into the home directory. In particular,
unless some custom configuration from the user or the desktop environment
is in use, config files will be found in ~/.config/wesnoth, save files
and add-ons will be found in ~/.local/share/wesnoth/<version>, and cache
files will be found in ~/.cache/wesnoth.

***

Lua is no longer an external dependency. It is now imported in the src/
directory so that it can be compiled with same C++ compiler as the engine.

>>> Terrain: <<<

There are many changes and improvements to terrain since 1.8.x.  Many of these changes are ongoing, so some terrains are half-baked, but overall the appearance should be much improved.


-- Highlights: --

* New Animated Water and new land to water transitions.
* Cave terrains are no longer extra dark, so they donÕt clash so much with other terrains.  The darkness in underground maps is now supplied by a "time of day" color shift.
* The base terrain beneath land villages can now be changed.
* The color of most terrains have been shifted, so that terrains look like they belong together.
* Many new terrain variants.


-- Important Changes for Map Conversion: --

* Cactuses and desert decorations. These are now *not* automatically part of Dd (desert). Mapmakers can now apply the embellishment "Desert Plants" (^Edp) over any base terrain, to get the density and placement of cacti that they want.

* Flower are are now an embellishment overlay (^Efm) "Embellishment, Flowers, Mixed". It can now be mixed with other base terrains. "Ggf" is depreciated. It still exists, but will eventually be removed. For a better appearance, convert to "Gg^Efm", or another base with "^Efm".

* "Desert Road" (Rd) used to be a rather dark and ambiguous dirt terrain. It's now much lighter as is appropriate for very dry dirt, but might have been used elsewhere as a dark terrain- which it no longer is. If dark was what you wanted switch to "Rb" or another of terrain.

* "Rocky Path" (Rp) was intended as an overgrown foresty path, but didn't make this very clear and seems to be often used for plain grey cobbles. It is now really overgrown. If that's not what you want use Rrc, or another flat terrain.


-- New Cave Varients: --

There is a new cave floor and 3 new cave walls.  Currently these are not very distinct, due to time constraints.  The following is what they will look like in a later release.

* Hewn Cave Wall (Xuc)  A wall roughly hewn from natural stone
* Earthy Cave Floor (Uue)  Soil and Stones mixed together.  Maybe some roots.
* Earthy Cave Wall (Xue)  Soil and Stones mixed together.  Maybe some roots.
* Earthy Hewn Cave Wall (Xuec)  Wooden Beam support the walls, as in a mine.


-- Warning: --
The stone walls with pillars and bricks (Xos, Xol) are attractive, but built in a way that makes them extremely difficult to mesh with other terrains.  These will likely remade for a future development release, so custom terrains or scenery items will likely no longer work quite right with them.

This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

CHANGES
=======

[section="Whiteboard"]
As you may have noticed, GSoC added a very nice multiplayer feature to the whiteboard, but not without its share of bugs. Fixing those sometimes creates other bugs or breaks some UI features, please be patient while we polish everything up.

Notable changes this release:
[list][*]Multi-turn moves are back in, but their UI is not complete yet.
[*] Planned actions now auto-execute when you end your turn, we didn't mention this in previous release notes.
[*] The option to hide allies' plans has no effect if you change it during a game.
[/list]

Also see the known bugs below.
[/section]

[section="Portraits in dialogs"]
Large portraits, especially high ones, should now work properly. For example TRoW scenario 5 (The Oldwood) now shows Elilmaldur-Rithrandil properly even when the screen resolution is 1920x480. If there are still issues with portraits not being shown, please let us know, either in this thread or by a bug report.

KNOWN BUGS
==========

Whiteboard:
[list][*] Multi-turn moves are still missing turn and terrain % indicators.
[*] The fake units from planned moves are not visible or selectable when under fog.
[*] Clicking on a planned recruit/recall gives the impression that you can give them orders, but you can't.
[/list]

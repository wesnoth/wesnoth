This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please
take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That
is making sure that spelling/grammer/whatever is usable and that you are using
 complete sentences, not just single words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.


There is a new experimental function to gray out not available languages in the
language selection dialog. This feature is available when Wesnoth is started
with the --new-widgets parameter. Packagers of various platforms are encouraged
to test this feature and report bugs when found. 

Users of Wesnoth 1.5.0 are encouraged to upgrade since Wesnoth 1.5.0 won't be
compatible with recent changes to the addon server.

Now content authors can specify the type of their addons. See the documentation
updates at http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/PblWML for details.

Multiplayer era authors can put their [binary_path] declarations inside the
MULTIPLAYER #ifdef block (or similar). This was a fix to an ancient, forgotten
bug that a developer noticed while playing a single-player campaign that
conflicted with a multiplayer era's binary_path.

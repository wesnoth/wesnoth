This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

[*]Crashes may occur during the loading screen. If those crashes happen to you, you can disable the loading screen animation by addding disable_loading screen_animation=yes in your preferences file.
[*]The MP server has trouble with Local player types in campaigns (bug [bug]21965[/bug]). We have decided to postpone dealing with this. In the meantime, you might try assigning such sides to the host, or running multiple instances of Wesnoth.
[*]Dialog In Replay Clearing Issue (bug [bug]24491[/bug]).

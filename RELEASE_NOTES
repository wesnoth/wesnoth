This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

The description key in [unit] should be unique, this key is used to avoid
the recall duplication bug, which have been around for a while.
(Note loading a lingermode savegame and continuing that one will still
result in a duplication.)

The bug that caused Wesnoth to crash when loading a saved multiplayer game from
the create-game interface has been fixed.

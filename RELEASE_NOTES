This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please
take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That
is making sure that spelling/grammer/whatever is usable and that you are using
 complete sentences, not just single words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

*** 1.5.5+svn

The excessive AI cautiouesness that afflicted the 1.5.5 release has been fixed.

Legend of Wesmere has been added to mainline.

There is a new tool for visually editing the journey tracks that appear on the 
story maps of many Wesnoth campaigns.  It is called 'trackplacer', and you
can read about it here: http://www.wesnoth.org/wiki/Authoring_tools

Many blocker bugs (yet not officially reported, *tsk*) related to the "update
add-ons" dialog functionality have been fixed.

The music namespace has been reorganized a bit.  UMC authors should know 
of the following name changes 

      main_menu.ogg -> transience.ogg, 
      main_menu_new.ogg -> main_menu.ogg
      nr-sad.ogg -> sad.ogg

We don't try to handle the first two automatically in wmllint, as it's
not perfectly clear whether UMC authors want the track or the riole when 
they name "main_menu.ogg".

This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

[*][set_menu_item] no longer fires repeatedly if the player holds the hotkey (bug #1711). If you were relying on repeated firing, add repeat_on_hold=yes to [default_hotkey].

[rasection="New Lua/WML features"]
[list]
[*]Add-on creators can now specify a comma-separated list of tags in the .pbl file, which are used by the Add-ons Manager when filtering add-ons by typing key words into the Filter box. This may be used to make it easier for people to find add-ons, e.g. by including their acronym among the tags. See [wiki]PblWML[/wiki] for details.

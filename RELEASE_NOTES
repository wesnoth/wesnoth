This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

[rasection="Additions and changes to the AI"]
[list]
[*]A new candidate action (CA), called [wiki=RCA_AI#The_Candidate_Actions_.28CAs.29_of_the_main_loop_Stage_in_the_RCA_AI]high XP attack[/wiki], has been added to all general Wesnoth AIs in mainline, fixing a short-coming in the default AI's combat CA. Previously, the AI would only attack units 1 experience point (XP) from leveling under very specific and rarely occurring circumstances. It was possible to exploit this, for example, for blocking vital passages or keeping key units alive without these units ever being attacked, making scenarios much easier than they were intended.

The new CA fixes this hole and will generally, but not blindly, attack such units now. The attack logic is explained [url=https://github.com/wesnoth/wesnoth/blob/master/data/ai/lua/ca_high_xp_attack.lua#L5]here[/url]. Since the new behavior is accomplished not by changing the existing attack code, but by adding a new candidate action, the previous behavior can be restored by removing the high_xp_attack CA, in case this is desired in specific scenarios.
[*]For content creators, a [wiki=Micro_AIs#Assassin_Squad_Micro_AI_.28ai_type.3Dassassin.29]new Micro AI[/wiki], controlling individual assassins or an entire assassin squad has been added. It is already being used in Heir to the Throne scenario 8, 'The Princess of Wesnoth'.
[*]A long standing bug which caused units with zero maximum moves not to attack adjacent enemies under certain circumstances has been fixed. This also (sometimes) affected units which could not move due to other circumstances (such as terrain).
[*]Two instances of the AI ignoring the [disable] weapon special have been fixed.

[/rasection]


[rasection="Tunnel functionality expanded"]
Tunnel functionality was expanded and the default behavior was altered in order to make moves through tunnels consistent with all other moves:
[list]
[*]Vison through tunnels is now possible and enabled by default. It can be turned off by setting allow_vision=no in the [tunnel] tag.
[*]Own and allied units on tunnel exits do not block the tunnel any more. The blocking behavior can be reenabled by setting pass_allied_units=no in the [tunnel] tag.
[/list]

KNOWN BUGS
==========

[raissue="Newly introduced in 1.13.x"]
[b]General bugs:[/b]

[list]
[*]Crashes may occur during the loading screen. If those crashes happen to you, you can disable the loading screen animation by addding disable_loading screen_animation=yes in your preferences file.
[*]The MP server has trouble with Local player types in campaigns (bug [bug]21965[/bug]). We have decided to postpone dealing with this. In the meantime, you might try assigning such sides to the host, or running multiple instances of Wesnoth.
[*]Wesnoth does not exist on the panel (bug [bug]24202[/bug]).
[*]"Name of Game" bleeds onto "Player/Type" label when leaving/entering the app (bug [bug]24437[/bug]).
[*]Inconsistent transparency on credits screen (bug [bug]24428[/bug]).
[*]Dialog In Replay Clearing Issue (bug [bug]24491[/bug]).

[/list]

[b]Bugs specific to Microsoft Windows:[/b]

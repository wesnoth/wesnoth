This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes
here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to
the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever
is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single
words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

For the braver ones the new version offers a multiplayer port of "Legend of Wesmere".
It's available when starting Wesnoth on the commandline with the "--debug" parameter.

Another round of lobby updates, replaced the player lists with a new widget
which allows better resize handling. This player list only has the players in
the current game unfolded by default.
The game list still has some issues with updating its contents in some cases,
which will hopefully be fixed with the next release.

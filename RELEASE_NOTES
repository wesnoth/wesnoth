This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

CHANGES

[rasection="Example section title"]
Example contents.
[/rasection]

[rasection="New game version dialog"]
Describe how awesome the new game version dialog is and how it replaces the old game paths dialog from 1.12.x
[/rasection]

[rasection="Fixed OOS errors on random maps"]
Some people experienced OOS errors on random maps due to sides being placed in different castles in the beginning of the game. This has now been fixed.
[/rasection]

[rasection="Replay turns during mp games"]
It is now possible to load an autosave in an networked mp game: when an autosave is loaded the local gamestate will be reset to the gamestate at that point. Then the game will be replayed (using the replay UI) until the current gamestate. When the current gamestate is reached the replay ui is removed and the game continues normally.
[/rasection]

[rasection="Default values for variables"]
In variable substitution it's now posible to specify default values for example name="$player_name?Klaus|" will evaluate to 'Klaus' in case the variable player_name is not set.
[/rasection]

[rasection="Custom [effect]s"]
It is now possible to create custom effects with the wesnoth.effects lua table.
[/rasection]

KNOWN BUGS
==========

[list]
[*] The mp server has trouble with "Local" player types in campaigns. We have decided to postpone dealing with this. In the meantime, you might try assigning such sides to the host, or running multiple instances of wesnoth. https://gna.org/bugs/?21965
[*] Text for entry2.

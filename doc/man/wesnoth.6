.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
Battle for
.B Wesnoth
is a turn-based fantasy strategy game.

Defeat all enemy leaders using a well-chosen cadre of troops, taking
care to manage your resources of gold and villages. All units have
their own strengths and weaknesses; to win, deploy your forces to
their best advantage while denying your foes the chance to do the
same. As units gain experience, they acquire new abilities and
become more powerful. Play in your own language and test your skill
against a smart computer opponent, or join Wesnoth's large community
of online players. Create your own custom units, scenarios or
campaigns, and share them with others.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.BI --bpp \ number
sets BitsPerPixel value. Example:
.B --bpp 32
.TP
.B -c, --campaign \ [<id_campaign>]
goes directly to the campaign with id <id_campaign>. A selection menu will appear if no id was specified.
.B Note:
When using this switch please ensure that you specify the data directory path as the final argument aswell, otherwise the game will take the campaign/scenario id as the data dir.

.I file
is specified, equivalent to
.B -l --load
.TP
.B --fps
displays the number of frames per second the game is currently running
at, in a corner of the screen.
.TP
.B -f, --fullscreen
runs the game in full screen mode.
.TP
.BI --gunzip \ infile.gz
decompresses a file which should be in gzip format and stores it
without the .gz suffix. The
.I infile.gz
will be removed.
.TP
.BI --gzip \ infile
compresses a file in gzip format, stores it as
.IR infile .gz
and removes
.IR infile .
.TP

The side-specific multiplayer options are marked with

.I number
has to be replaced by a side number. It usually is 1 or 2 but depends on
the number of players possible in the chosen scenario.
.TP
.BI --ai_config number = value
selects a configuration file to load for the AI controller for this side.
.TP
.BI --algorithm number = value
selects a non-standard algorithm to be used by the AI controller for
this side. Available values:
.B idle_ai
and
.BR sample_ai .
.TP
.BI --controller number = value
selects the controller for this side. Available values:
.B human
and
.BR ai .
.TP
.BI --era= value

.B --exit-at-end
exits once the scenario is over, without displaying victory/defeat dialog which requires the user to click OK.
This is also used for scriptable benchmarking.
.TP
.B --nogui
runs the game without the GUI. Must appear before
.B --multiplayer
to have the desired effect.
.TP
.BI --parm number = name : value
sets additional parameters for this side. This parameter depends on the
options used with
.B --controller
and
.BR --algorithm .
It should only be useful for people designing their own AI. (not yet
documented completely)
.TP
.BI --scenario= value
selects a multiplayer scenario by id. The default scenario id is
.BR multiplayer_The_Freelands .
.TP
.BI --side number = value
selects a faction of the current era for this side. The faction is

file.
.TP
.BI --turns= value
sets the number of turns for the chosen scenario. The default is
.BR 50 .

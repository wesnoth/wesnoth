.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.
.B wesnoth
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
[\fIPATH_TO_DATA\fR]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
Battle for
.B Wesnoth
is a turn-based fantasy strategy game.

Defeat all enemy leaders using a well-chosen cadre of troops, taking
care to manage your resources of gold and villages. All units have
their own strengths and weaknesses; to win, deploy your forces to
their best advantage while denying your foes the chance to do the
same. As units gain experience, they acquire new abilities and
become more powerful. Play in your own language and test your skill
against a smart computer opponent, or join Wesnoth's large community
of online players. Create your own custom units, scenarios or
campaigns, and share them with others.

.SH Options for --multiplayer
.
The side-specific multiplayer options are marked with
.IR number .
.I number
has to be replaced by a side number. It usually is 1 or 2 but depends on
the number of players possible in the chosen scenario.
.TP
.BI --ai_config number = value
selects a configuration file to load for the AI controller for this side.
.TP
.BI --algorithm number = value
selects a non-standard algorithm to be used by the AI controller for
this side. Available values:
.B idle_ai
and
.BR sample_ai .
.TP
.BI --controller number = value
selects the controller for this side. Available values:
.B human
and
.BR ai .
.TP
.BI --era= value
use this option to play in the selected era instead of the
.B Default
era. The era is chosen by an id. Eras are described in the
.B "data/multiplayer/eras.cfg"
file.
.TP
.B --exit-at-end
exits once the scenario is over, without displaying victory/defeat dialog which requires the user to click OK.
This is also used for scriptable benchmarking.
.TP
.B --ignore-map-settings
do not use map settings, use default values instead.
.TP
.BI --multiplayer-repeat= value
repeats a multiplayer game
.I value
times. Best to use with
.B --nogui
for scriptable benchmarking.
.TP
.B --nogui
runs the game without the GUI. Must appear before
.B --multiplayer
to have the desired effect.
.TP
.BI --parm number = name : value
sets additional parameters for this side. This parameter depends on the
options used with
.B --controller
and
.BR --algorithm .
It should only be useful for people designing their own AI. (not yet
documented completely)
.TP
.BI --scenario= value
selects a multiplayer scenario by id. The default scenario id is
.BR multiplayer_The_Freelands .
.TP
.BI --side number = value
selects a faction of the current era for this side. The faction is
chosen by an id. Factions are described in the data/multiplayer.cfg
file.

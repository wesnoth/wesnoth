.SH SYNOPSIS

.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
Battle for
.B Wesnoth
is a turn-based fantasy strategy game.

Defeat all enemy leaders using a well-chosen cadre of troops, taking 
care to manage your resources of gold and villages. All units have 
their own strengths and weaknesses; to win, deploy your forces to 
their best advantage while denying your foes the chance to do the 
same. As units gain experience, they acquire new abilities and 
become more powerful. Play in your own language and test your skill 
against a smart computer opponent, or join Wesnoth's large community 
of on-line players. Create your own custom units, scenarios or 
campaigns, and share them with others.

.SH NAME
wesnoth \- Battle for Wesnoth, a turn\-based fantasy strategy game
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.
\fBwesnoth\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP] [\fIPATH_TO_DATA\fP]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
Battle for \fBWesnoth\fP is a turn\-based fantasy strategy game.

Defeat all enemy leaders using a well\-chosen cadre of troops, taking care to
manage your resources of gold and villages. All units have their own
strengths and weaknesses; to win, deploy your forces to their best advantage
while denying your foes the chance to do the same. As units gain experience,
they acquire new abilities and become more powerful. Play in your own
language and test your skill against a smart computer opponent, or join
Wesnoth's large community of online players. Create your own custom units,
scenarios or campaigns, and share them with others.

them through \fB\-p\fP first). Outputs the difference as DiffWML on standard
output or to the file indicated by \fI\-\-output\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-e[\fP\fIfile\fP\fB],\ \-\-editor[\fP\fI=file\fP\fB]\fP
start the in\-game map editor directly. If \fIfile\fP is specified, equivalent
to \fB\-l\fP \fB\-\-load\fP.

log domain. Available levels: \fBerror\fP,\ \fBwarning\fP,\ \fBinfo\fP,\ \fBdebug\fP,\ \fBnone\fP.  By default the \fBwarning\fP level is used for most domains, but
\fBdeprecation\fP is set to \fBnone\fP by default unless combined with the \fB\-d\fP
option.
.TP 
\fB\-\-log\-precise\fP

WESNOTH_NO_LOG_FILE can also be set as an alternative. Log files are created
in the logs directory under the userdata folder.
.TP 
\fB\-\-log\-to\-file\fP
log output is written to a file. Cancels the effect of \-\-no\-log\-to\-file
whether implicit or explicit.

disables the anonymisation that's normally applied when logging, for example
replacing user names with USER.
.TP 
\fB\-\-wnoconsole\fP

.TP 
\fB\-\-preprocess\-output\-macros[\fP\fI=target\-file\fP\fB]\fP
used only by the \fB\-\-preprocess\fP command. Will output all preprocessed
macros in the target file. If the file is not specified the output will be
file '_MACROS_.cfg' in the target directory of preprocess's command. The
output file can be passed to \fB\-\-preprocess\-input\-macros\fP.  This switch
should be typed before the \fB\-\-preprocess\fP command.
.TP

.
.SH "Options for \-\-multiplayer"
.
The side\-specific multiplayer options are marked with \fInumber\fP.  \fInumber\fP
has to be replaced by a side number. It usually is 1 or 2 but depends on the
number of players possible in the chosen scenario.
.TP 
\fB\-\-ai\-config\fP\fI\ number\fP\fB:\fP\fIvalue\fP
selects a configuration file to load for the AI controller for this side.
.TP 
\fB\-\-algorithm\fP\fI\ number\fP\fB:\fP\fIvalue\fP
selects a non\-standard algorithm to be used by the AI controller for this
side. The algorithm is defined by an \fB[ai]\fP tag, which can be a core one
either in "data/ai/ais" or "data/ai/dev" or an algorithm defined by an
add\-on. Available values include: \fBidle_ai\fP and \fBexperimental_ai\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-\-controller\fP\fI\ number\fP\fB:\fP\fIvalue\fP
selects the controller for this side. Available values: \fBhuman\fP, \fBai\fP, and
\fBnull\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-\-era\fP\fI\ value\fP
use this option to play in the selected era instead of the \fBDefault\fP
era. The era is chosen by an id. Eras are described in the
\fBdata/multiplayer/eras.cfg\fP file.
.TP 
\fB\-\-exit\-at\-end\fP
exits once the scenario is over, without displaying the victory/defeat
dialogue which normally requires the user to click End Scenario. This is
also used for scripted benchmarking.
.TP 
\fB\-\-ignore\-map\-settings\fP
do not use map settings, use default values instead.
.TP 
\fB\-\-label\fP\fI\ label\fP
sets the \fIlabel\fP for AIs.
.TP 
\fB\-\-multiplayer\-repeat\fP\fI\ value\fP
repeats a multiplayer game \fIvalue\fP times. Best to use with \fB\-\-nogui\fP for
script\-based benchmarking.
.TP 
\fB\-\-parm\fP\fI\ number\fP\fB:\fP\fIname\fP\fB:\fP\fIvalue\fP
sets additional parameters for this side. This parameter depends on the
options used with \fB\-\-controller\fP and \fB\-\-algorithm\fP.  It should only be
useful for people designing their own AI. (not yet documented completely)
.TP 
\fB\-\-scenario\fP\fI\ value\fP
selects a multiplayer scenario by id. The default scenario id is
\fBmultiplayer_The_Freelands\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-\-side\fP\fI\ number\fP\fB:\fP\fIvalue\fP
selects a faction of the current era for this side. The faction is chosen by
an id. Factions are described in the data/multiplayer.cfg file.
.TP 
\fB\-\-turns\fP\fI\ value\fP
sets the number of turns for the chosen scenario. By default no turn limit
is set.
.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.
Normal exit status is 0.  An exit status of 1 indicates an (SDL, video,
fonts, etc) initialization error. An exit status of 2 indicates an error
with the command line options.
.br
When running unit tests (with \fB\ \-u\fP), the exit status is different. An
exit status of 0 indicates that the test passed, and 1 indicates that the
test failed. An exit status of 3 indicates that the test passed, but
produced an invalid replay file. An exit status of 4 indicates that the test
passed, but the replay produced errors. These latter two are only returned
if \fB\-\-noreplaycheck\fP is not passed.

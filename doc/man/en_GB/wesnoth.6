.SH NAME
wesnoth \- Battle for Wesnoth, a turn\-based fantasy strategy game
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.
\fBwesnoth\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP] [\fIPATH_TO_DATA\fP]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
Battle for \fBWesnoth\fP is a turn\-based fantasy strategy game.

Defeat all enemy leaders using a well\-chosen cadre of troops, taking care to
manage your resources of gold and villages. All units have their own
strengths and weaknesses; to win, deploy your forces to their best advantage
while denying your foes the chance to do the same. As units gain experience,
they acquire new abilities and become more powerful. Play in your own
language and test your skill against a smart computer opponent, or join
Wesnoth's large community of online players. Create your own custom units,
scenarios or campaigns, and share them with others.

folder is specified, it will be preprocessed recursively based on the known
preprocessor rules. The common macros from the "data/core/macros" directory
will be preprocessed before the specified resources.  Example: \fB\-p

macros in the target file. If the file is not specified the output will be
file '_MACROS_.cfg' in the target directory of preprocess's command. The
output file can be passed to \fB\-\-preprocess\-input\-macros\fP.  This switch
should be typed before the \fB\-\-preprocess\fP command.

\fB\-\-nogui\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-\-translations\-over\fP\fI\ percent\fP

sets the WML schema for use with \fB\-V,\-\-validate\fP.
.TP

sets the user configuration directory to \fIname\fP under $HOME or "My
Documents\eMy Games" for windows.  You can also specify an absolute path for
the configuration directory outside the $HOME or "My Documents\eMy
Games". On Windows it is also possible to specify a directory relative to
the process working directory by using path starting with ".\e" or "..\e".
Under X11 this is set to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or $HOME/.config/wesnoth by
default, on other systems to the user data path.
.TP 
\fB\-\-userconfig\-path\fP
prints the path of the user configuration directory and exits.
.TP 
\fB\-\-userdata\-dir\fP\fI\ name\fP
sets the user data directory to \fIname\fP under $HOME or "My Documents\eMy
Games" for windows.  You can also specify an absolute path for the user data
directory outside the $HOME or "My Documents\eMy Games". On Windows it is
also possible to specify a directory relative to the process working
directory by using path starting with ".\e" or "..\e".
.TP 
\fB\-\-userdata\-path\fP

runs the game in windowed mode.
.TP 
\fB\-\-with\-replay\fP
replays the game loaded with the \fB\-\-load\fP option.
.
.SH "Options for \-\-multiplayer"
.
The side\-specific multiplayer options are marked with \fInumber\fP.  \fInumber\fP
has to be replaced by a side number. It usually is 1 or 2 but depends on the
number of players possible in the chosen scenario.
.TP 
\fB\-\-ai\-config\fP\fI\ number\fP\fB:\fP\fIvalue\fP
selects a configuration file to load for the AI controller for this side.
.TP 
\fB\-\-algorithm\fP\fI\ number\fP\fB:\fP\fIvalue\fP
selects a non\-standard algorithm to be used by the AI controller for this
side. The algorithm is defined by an \fB[ai]\fP tag, which can be a core one
either in "data/ai/ais" or "data/ai/dev" or an algorithm defined by an
add\-on. Available values include: \fBidle_ai\fP and \fBexperimental_ai\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-\-controller\fP\fI\ number\fP\fB:\fP\fIvalue\fP
selects the controller for this side. Available values: \fBhuman\fP, \fBai\fP, and
\fBnull\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-\-era\fP\fI\ value\fP
use this option to play in the selected era instead of the \fBDefault\fP
era. The era is chosen by an id. Eras are described in the
\fBdata/multiplayer/eras.cfg\fP file.
.TP 
\fB\-\-exit\-at\-end\fP
exits once the scenario is over, without displaying the victory/defeat
dialogue which normally requires the user to click End Scenario. This is
also used for scripted benchmarking.
.TP 
\fB\-\-ignore\-map\-settings\fP
do not use map settings, use default values instead.
.TP 
\fB\-\-label\fP\fI\ label\fP
sets the \fIlabel\fP for AIs.
.TP 
\fB\-\-multiplayer\-repeat\fP\fI\ value\fP
repeats a multiplayer game \fIvalue\fP times. Best to use with \fB\-\-nogui\fP for
script\-based benchmarking.
.TP 
\fB\-\-parm\fP\fI\ number\fP\fB:\fP\fIname\fP\fB:\fP\fIvalue\fP
sets additional parameters for this side. This parameter depends on the
options used with \fB\-\-controller\fP and \fB\-\-algorithm\fP.  It should only be
useful for people designing their own AI. (not yet documented completely)
.TP 
\fB\-\-scenario\fP\fI\ value\fP
selects a multiplayer scenario by id. The default scenario id is
\fBmultiplayer_The_Freelands\fP.
.TP 
\fB\-\-side\fP\fI\ number\fP\fB:\fP\fIvalue\fP
selects a faction of the current era for this side. The faction is chosen by
an id. Factions are described in the data/multiplayer.cfg file.
.TP 
\fB\-\-turns\fP\fI\ value\fP
sets the number of turns for the chosen scenario. By default no turn limit
is set.
.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.
Normal exit status is 0.  An exit status of 1 indicates an (SDL, video,
fonts, etc) initialization error. An exit status of 2 indicates an error
with the command line options.
.br
When running unit tests (with\fB\ \-u\fP), the exit status is different. An exit
status of 0 indicates that the test passed, and 1 indicates that the test
failed. An exit status of 3 indicates that the test passed, but produced an
invalid replay file. An exit status of 4 indicates that the test passed, but
the replay produced errors. These latter two are only returned if
\fB\-\-noreplaycheck\fP is not passed. An exit status of 2 indicates that the
test timed out, when used with the deprecated \fB\-\-timeout\fP option.

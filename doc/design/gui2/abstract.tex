Late 2007 I started to rewrite the gui engine of Wesnoth, this project is called
the gui2 project. A lot of code and documentation has been written since. The
documentation is available at:
\begin{itemize}
\item \url{http://wiki.wesnoth.org/GUIToolkit} The general information
	regarding the project and documentation regarding the WML used.
\item \url{http://devdocs.wesnoth.org} The general doxygen information.
\item \url{http://devdocs.wesnoth.org/pages.html} Contains some links to more
	gui2 specific information.
\end{itemize}

This documentation describes a lot of the details and the wiki describes some of
the design from the WML side. Doxygen contains some information regarding the
design of the C++ side but it misses the overall design. This paper tries to
fill that gap, trying to explain more of the overall design and some of the
design choices.

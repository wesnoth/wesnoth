veterans. In later games, recall your toughest warriors and form a deadly
host against whom none can stand! Choose units from a large pool of
specialists, and hand-pick a force with the right strengths to fight well on
different terrains against all manner of opposition.</p><p>Wesnoth has many different sagas waiting to be played. You can battle orcs,
undead, and bandits on the marches of the Kingdom of Wesnoth; fight
alongside dragons in the lofty peaks, elves in the green reaches of the
Aethenwood, dwarves in the great halls of Knalga, or even merfolk in the Bay
of Pearls. You can fight to regain the throne of Wesnoth, or use your dread
power over the Undead to dominate the land of mortals, or lead your glorious
Orcish tribe to victory against the humans who dared despoil your lands.</p><p>You will be able to select from among over two hundred unit types (infantry,
cavalry, archers, and mages are just the beginning) and fight actions
ranging from small-unit ambushes to clashes of vast armies. You can also
challenge your friends – or strangers – and fight in epic multi-player
fantasy battles.</p><p>Battle for Wesnoth is open-source software, and a thriving community of
volunteers co-operates to improve the game. You can create your own custom
units, write your own scenarios, and even script full-blown
campaigns. User-maintained content is available from an add-on server, and
the very best of it is incorporated into Battle for Wesnoth’s official
releases.</p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="_getting_started"></a>Chapter 1. Getting Started</h1></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_the_world"></a>1.1. The World</h2></div></div></div><p>The known portion of the Great Continent, on which Wesnoth abides, is
generally divided into three areas: the Northlands, which are generally
lawless; the kingdom of Wesnoth and its occasional principality, Elensefar;
and the domain of the South-West Elves in the Aethenwood and beyond.</p><p>The Kingdom of Wesnoth lies in the centre of this land. Its borders are the
Great River to the north, the Dulatus Hills in the east and south, the edge
of the Aethenwood to the south-west, and the Ocean to the west. Elensefar, a
once-province of Wesnoth, is bordered by the Great River to the north, a
loosely defined line with Wesnoth to the east, the Bay of Pearls to the
south, and the ocean to the west.</p><p>The Northlands is the wild country north of the Great River. Various groups
of orcs, dwarves, barbarians and elves populate the region.  To the north
and east lies the forest of Lintanir, where the great kingdom of the
North-Elves keeps to its own mysterious affairs.</p><p>Over the land are scattered villages where you can heal your troops and
gather the income required to support your army. You will also have to cross
mountains and rivers, push through forests, hills and tundra, and cross open
grassland. In each of these areas different creatures have adapted to live
there and can travel more easily and fight better when they are in familiar
terrain.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_the_creatures"></a>1.1.1. The Creatures</h3></div></div></div><p>In the world of Wesnoth there dwell humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, drakes,
saurians, mermen, nagas, and many other races yet more obscure and
wondrous. In accursed lands walk undead and ghosts and spectres; monsters
lurk in its ruins and dungeons.  Each has adapted to particular
terrains. Humans inhabit primarily the temperate grasslands. In the hills,
mountains and underground caves orcs and dwarves are most at home. In the
forests the elves reign supreme. In the oceans and rivers mermen and nagas
dominate.</p><p>For game purposes, the races group into factions; for example, orcs often
co-operate with trolls, and elves or dwarves with humans. Some other
factions reflect divisions within human
society — loyalists vs. outlaws, for example. In most
campaigns, you will control units drawn from a single faction. But sometimes
factions make alliances with others, so you may face more than one faction
in a scenario.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_finding_your_way"></a>1.2. Finding Your Way</h2></div></div></div><p>When Wesnoth first starts it displays an initial background and a column of
buttons called the Main Menu. The buttons only work with a mouse. For the
impatient, we recommend you: click the "Language" button to set your
language; then click the "Tutorial" button to run the tutorial; and then
play the campaign, "A Tale of Two Brothers" by clicking the "Campaign"
button and selecting it from the list provided.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/main-menu-1.11.9.jpg" alt="Main Menu" /></span></p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">
Tutorial
</span></dt><dd>
 The tutorial is a real, but basic, game which teaches you some of the basic
controls needed to play the game. Winning or losing is not important here,
but learning what to do is. Click the Tutorial button to play. In the
Tutorial you are in the role of the prince Konrad or the princess
Li’sar, learning from the Elder Mage Delfador — pay attention or he
might turn you into a newt.

Campaign
</span></dt><dd>
 Wesnoth was primarily designed to play campaigns. Campaigns are a series of
connected scenarios. Click this button to start a new campaign. You will be
presented with a list of campaigns available on your computer (more can be
downloaded if you wish). Select your campaign and click OK to start or
Cancel to quit. Each campaign has a difficulty level: easy, medium (normal),
and hard. We recommend medium as this level is challenging, but not
difficult. You may not change the difficulty during the campaign. In case
you have serious problems fighting your way through easy difficulty, the
guide about <a class="link" href="#basic_strategy" title="3.1. Basic Strategy">Basic Strategy</a> will surely
help you. Once you have selected the difficulty, you will start with the
first scenario of the campaign.

Play a sequence of connected scenarios, known as a campaign, against the
computer.
</li><li class="listitem">
Play a single scenario against computer or human opponents.
</li></ul></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_campaigns"></a>1.3.1. Campaigns</h3></div></div></div><p>Campaigns are sequences of battles with a connecting storyline. Typical
campaigns have about 10–20 scenarios. The main advantage with campaigns is
that they allow you to develop your army. As you complete each scenario, the
remaining units at the end are saved for you to use in the next scenario. If
you choose not to use a unit at all during a scenario it is carried over to
the next, so you don’t lose units you don’t use.</p><p>The campaign is the primary form in which Wesnoth is intended to be played,
is probably the most enjoyable, and is the recommended way for new players
to learn the game.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="scenarios"></a>1.3.2. Scenarios</h3></div></div></div><p>A single scenario takes about 30 minutes to 2 hours to complete. This is the
fastest way to play, but your units are not saved and you cannot use
campaign units. You can play scenarios against the computer or against other
players either over the internet or at your computer. Scenarios are accessed
through the "Multiplayer" button on the main menu.</p><p>In general multiplayer games are played against other players via the
Internet (you can also run them on your LAN if you have one). All these
games are co-ordinated through the Wesnoth multiplayer server. Multiplayer
games can take anywhere from 1 hour to 10 hours, depending on how many
players there are (and the size of the map). The average time is between 3
to 7 hours. Games can be saved and loaded as many times as you like. So,
it’s possible for some games to last 1 or 2 weeks, even though the
play time is only a few hours. You cannot carry over units in multiplayer
from one scenario to the next, so building up your army’s strength is
possible only within the scenario.</p><p>There are several possible options you are provided with when clicking on
the "Multiplayer" button:</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/multiplayer-1.11.9.jpg" alt="Multiplayer dialog" /></span></p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_login"></a>Login</h4></div></div></div><p>This will be your name on the multiplayer server. If you have an account on
the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.wesnoth.org/forum" target="_top">Wesnoth forums</a>, you
may use the same username and password for joining the official server. A
password box will pop up if a password is required for the current
username. You cannot use a registered name without the password.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_join_official_server"></a>Join official Server</h4></div></div></div><p>This option directly connects you to the official server. You will end in
the lobby where you can create your games as you wish and where many games
are already open and maybe some players already waiting to join in a new
match.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_connect_to_server"></a>Connect to Server</h4></div></div></div><p>This option opens a dialog box allowing you to enter the address of the
machine to join. In this dialogue there also is the button "View List" that
does show a list of official servers that can be used as backup if the main
server is currently not available.</p><p>A complete list of official and user set-up servers is listed at this
website: <a class="ulink" href="https://wesnoth.org/wiki/MultiplayerServers" target="_top">Multiplayer
servers</a>.</p><p>You can also reach servers hosted by any other player with this menu
option.  So if you got a server running in your local network, just enter
the address and port number (default: 15000). If you for example want to
connect to a server running on the machine with the address 192.168.0.10 and
the default port, you would enter this in the dialog: 192.168.0.10:15000</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_host_networked_game"></a>Host Networked Game</h4></div></div></div><p>To start a multiplayer game without using an external multiplayer server a
local server, which is usually named <span style="color: red">&lt;span&gt;<span style="color: red">&lt;em&gt;wesnothd&lt;/em&gt;</span>&lt;/span&gt;</span>, is needed. The server is
automatically started in the background when selecting this option. It will
be stopped once all players have left the server.  Other players need to be
able to connect to your port 15000 using TCP to play with you on your
server. If you are behind a firewall, you will probably need to change your
firewall settings to allow incoming connections to port 15000, and tell your
firewall to forward such traffic to the machine hosting the game. You should
not need to make firewall changes to join games hosted on a public server or
by someone else.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_local_game"></a>Local Game</h4></div></div></div><p>This creates a game just running on your computer. You can either use it as
hot seat game where everyone plays at the same computers by taking turns in
the <span class="emphasis"><em>hot seat</em></span>. Hot seat games will take about the same
time to play as games played over the Internet. Or you can just play a
scenario against AI opponents rather than human players. This can be a good
way to become familiar with the various maps that are used for multiplayer
games before playing against real opponents. It can also be used as a simple
way to explore the capabilities of units from the different factions by
choosing which faction you will play and which faction your opponents are in
these games.  Of course, you can also mix both in one game. That is, play
together in a game with a friend against an AI opponent.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="game_screen"></a>1.3.3. The Game Screen</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/game-screen-1.11.9.jpg" alt="Game Screen" /></span></p><p>Regardless of whether you are playing a scenario or a campaign, the basic

on the map. One of these will be your commander (identified by a little
golden crown icon). Your commander is usually placed in a castle on a
special hex called a keep. Whenever your commander is on a keep (not only
your own, but also the keep of any enemy castles you capture) and you have
enough gold, you can recruit units for your army. In later scenarios you can
recall experienced units that survived earlier scenarios. From here, you can
start to build your army to conquer the enemy.</p><p>The first thing you will probably want to do is recruit your first
unit. Press <code class="literal">Ctrl+r</code> (or right click on an empty castle hex
and select "Recruit") and you will be able to recruit a unit from a list of
all the units available to you. Each recruit is placed on an empty castle
hex. Once you have filled the castle, you cannot recruit any more until
units move off. Your opponent’s commander is similarly placed on its
castle keep and will begin by recruiting its troops — so
don’t dilly-dally looking at the scenery, there’s a battle to be
won.</p><p>At the end of each successful scenario, all your remaining troops are
automatically saved. At the start of the next scenario you may recall them
in a similar way to recruiting. Recalled troops are often more experienced
than recruits and usually a better choice.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_your_army"></a>1.3.5. Your Army</h3></div></div></div><p>All game types use the same soldiers, called units. Each unit is identified
by Race, Level, and Class. Each unit has strengths and weaknesses, based on
their Resistances, current Terrain, and Level. Full details are in the in
game help.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_life_and_death_experience"></a>1.3.6. Life and Death — Experience</h3></div></div></div><p>As your troops gain battle experience, they will learn more skills and
become stronger. They will also die in battle, so you’ll need to
recruit and recall more when that happens. But choose wisely, for each has
strengths and weaknesses a cunning opponent will quickly exploit.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_victory_and_defeat"></a>1.3.7. Victory and Defeat</h3></div></div></div><p>Pay careful attention to the Objectives pop-up box at the beginning of each
scenario. Usually you will achieve victory by killing all enemy leaders, and
only be defeated by having your leader killed. But scenarios may have other
victory objectives — getting your leader to a designated point, say, or
rescuing someone, or solving a puzzle, or holding out against a siege until

gold to maintain them. You start each scenario with gold carried over from
previous scenarios (although each scenario ensures you have at least a
minimum amount of gold to start if you didn’t carry over enough from
previous scenarios) and can gain more by meeting scenario objectives quickly
and, during a scenario, by controlling villages. Each village you control
will give you two gold pieces income per turn. When you first start a
scenario it is usually worthwhile to gain control of as many villages as you
can to ensure you have sufficient income to wage war. You can see your
current gold and current income at the top of the screen as described in the
section on the <a class="link" href="#game_screen" title="1.3.3. The Game Screen">game screen</a>.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_save_and_load"></a>1.3.9. Save and Load</h3></div></div></div><p>At the start of each scenario, your game state is normally saved. If you are
defeated, you may load it and try again. Once you have succeeded, you will
again be asked to save the next scenario and play that. If you have to stop
playing during a scenario, you can save your turn and load it again
later. Just remember, a good Battle for Wesnoth player never needs to save
during a scenario. However, most beginners tend to do so rather often.</p></div></div></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="_playing"></a>Chapter 2. Playing</h1></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_controls"></a>2.1. Controls</h2></div></div></div><p>These are the default control keys.

assigned randomly to units when they are created. Most units receive two
traits.</p><p>The possible traits for most units are as follows:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">
Intelligent
</span></dt><dd>
  Intelligent units require 20% less experience than usual to advance (Trolls
do not get this trait).  Intelligent units are very useful at the beginning
of a campaign as they can advance to higher levels more quickly. Later in
campaigns Intelligent is not quite as useful because the After Maximum Level
Advancement (AMLA)  is not as significant a change as advancing a level. If
you have many <span class="emphasis"><em>maximum level</em></span> units you may wish to
recall units with more useful traits.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Quick
</span></dt><dd>
  Quick units have 1 extra movement point, but 5% less HP than usual.  Quick
is the most noticeable trait, particularly in slower moving units such as
trolls or heavy infantry. Units with the Quick trait often have greatly
increased mobility in rough terrain, which can be important to consider when
deploying your forces. Also, Quick units aren’t quite as tough as
units without this trait and are subsequently less good at holding contested
positions.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Resilient
</span></dt><dd>
  Resilient units have 4 HP plus 1 HP per level more than usual.  Resilient
units can be useful at all stages of a campaign, and this is a useful trait
for all units. Resilient is often most helpful as a trait when it occurs in
a unit that has some combination of low hit-points, good defence, or high
resistances. Resilient units are especially useful for holding strategic
positions against opponents.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Strong
</span></dt><dd>
  Strong units do 1 more damage for every successful strike in melee combat,
and have 1 more HP.  While useful for any close-combat unit, Strong is most
effective for units who have a high number of swings such as the Elvish
Fighter. Strong units can be very useful when a tiny bit of extra damage is
all that is needed to turn a damaging stroke into a killing blow.
</dd></dl></div><p>There are also some traits that are assigned only for certain units or only
for units of a certain race. These are:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">
Dexterous
</span></dt><dd>
  Dexterous units do 1 more damage for every successful strike in ranged
combat.  Dexterous is a trait possessed only by Elves. The Elven people are
known for their uncanny grace, and their great facility with the bow. Some,
however, are gifted with natural talent that exceeds their brethren. These
elves inflict an additional point of damage with each arrow.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Fearless
</span></dt><dd>
  Does not suffer from a negative attack bonus during its unfavourable time of
day (Heavy Infantry, Necrophage, Trolls, Walking Corpses).
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Healthy
</span></dt><dd>
  Renowned for their vitality, some dwarves are sturdier than others and can
rest heal even when travelling or fighting.  Healthy units have 1 HP plus 1
HP per level more than usual and rest heal the usual 2 HP after each turn
regardless.
</dd></dl></div><p>There are also some traits that are not assigned randomly.  These traits can
either be assigned by the scenario designer or are always assigned based on
the unit type:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">
Aged
</span></dt><dd>
  The oldest units may have the Aged trait, receiving an 8 points HP decrease
and having -1 movement and melee damage.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Dim
</span></dt><dd>
  Units with the Dim trait require 20% more experience to advance.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Elemental
</span></dt><dd>
  Elemental units aren’t alive and thus are immune to poison, and drain
and plague don’t work on them.  Elemental units generally have
<span class="emphasis"><em>Elemental</em></span> as their only trait.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Feral
</span></dt><dd>
  Units with the Feral trait only receive 50% defence in villages regardless
of the base terrain the village is on.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Loyal
</span></dt><dd>
  Loyal units don’t incur upkeep. Most units incur an upkeep cost at the
end of every turn, which is equal to their level. Loyal units do not incur
this cost.  During campaigns, certain units may opt to join the
player’s forces of their own volition. These units are marked with the
Loyal trait. Although they may require payment to be recalled, they never
incur any upkeep costs. This can make them invaluable during a long
campaign, when gold is in short supply.  This trait is never given to
recruited units, so it may be unwise to dismiss such units or to send them
to a foolish death.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Mechanical
</span></dt><dd>
  Mechanical units aren’t alive and thus are immune to poison, and drain
and plague don’t work on them.  Mechanical units generally have
<span class="emphasis"><em>Mechanical</em></span> as their only trait.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Slow
</span></dt><dd>
  Large, unwieldy units with the Slow trait have -1 movement and 5% more
hit-points.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Undead
</span></dt><dd>
  Undead units are immune to poison, also drain and plague doesn’t work
on them.  Undead units generally have <span class="emphasis"><em>Undead</em></span> as their
only trait. Since Undead units are the bodies of the dead, risen to fight
again, poison has no effect upon them. This can make them invaluable in
dealing with foes who use poison in conjunction with their attacks.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Weak
</span></dt><dd>
  Units may have the Weak trait, receiving a -1 increment in hit-points and
melee damage.
</dd></dl></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_unit_specialties"></a>2.3.3. Unit Specialities</h3></div></div></div><p>Certain units have special attacks. These are listed below:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">
Backstab
</span></dt><dd>
  When used offensively, this attack deals double damage if there is an enemy
of the target on the opposite side of the target, and that unit is not
incapacitated (e.g. petrified).
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Berserk
</span></dt><dd>
  Whether used offensively or defensively, this attack presses the engagement
until one of the combatants is slain, or 30 rounds of attacks have occurred.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Charge
</span></dt><dd>
  When used offensively, this attack deals double damage to the target. It
also causes this unit to take double damage from the target’s
counter-attack.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Drain
</span></dt><dd>
  This unit drains health from living units, healing itself for half the
amount of damage it deals (rounded down).
</dd><dt><span class="term">
First Strike
</span></dt><dd>
  This unit always strikes first with this attack, even if they are defending.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Magical
</span></dt><dd>
  This attack always has a 70% chance to hit regardless of the defensive
ability of the unit being attacked.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Marksman
</span></dt><dd>
  When used offensively, this attack always has at least a 60% chance to hit.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Plague
</span></dt><dd>
  When a unit is killed by a Plague attack, that unit is replaced with a
Walking Corpse on the same side as the unit with the Plague attack. This
doesn’t work on Undead or units in villages.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Poison
</span></dt><dd>
  This attack poisons the target. Poisoned units lose 8 HP every turn until
they are cured or are reduced to 1 HP. Poison cannot, of itself, kill a
unit.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Slow
</span></dt><dd>
  This attack slows the target until it ends a turn. Slow halves the damage
caused by attacks and the movement cost for a slowed unit is doubled. A unit
that is slowed will feature a snail icon in its sidebar information when it
is selected.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Petrify
</span></dt><dd>
  This attack petrifies the target, turning it to stone. Units that have been
petrified may not move or attack.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Swarm
</span></dt><dd>
  The number of strikes of this attack decreases when the unit is wounded. The
number of strikes is proportional to the % of HP/maximum HP the unit
has. For example a unit with 3/4 of its maximum HP will get 3/4 of the
number of strikes.
</dd></dl></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_abilities"></a>2.3.4. Abilities</h3></div></div></div><p>Some units have abilities that either directly affect other units, or have
an effect on how the unit interacts with other units. These abilities are
listed below:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">
Ambush
</span></dt><dd>
  This unit can hide in forest, and remain undetected by its enemies.  Enemy
units cannot see this unit while it is in forest, except if they have units
next to it. Any enemy unit that first discovers this unit immediately loses
all its remaining movement.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Concealment
</span></dt><dd>
  This unit can hide in villages (with the exception of water villages), and
remain undetected by its enemies, except by those standing next to it.
Enemy units cannot see this unit while it is in a village, except if they
have units next to it. Any enemy unit that first discovers this unit
immediately loses all its remaining movement.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Cures
</span></dt><dd>
  A unit which can cure an ally of poison, although the ally will receive no
additional healing on the turn it is cured of the poison.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Feeding
</span></dt><dd>
  This unit gains 1 hit-point added to its maximum whenever it kills a unit,
except units that are immune to plague.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Heals +4
</span></dt><dd>
  Allows the unit to heal adjacent friendly units at the beginning of each
turn.  A unit cared for by this healer may heal up to 4 HP per turn, or stop
poison from taking effect for that turn.  A poisoned unit cannot be cured of
its poison by a healer, and must seek the care of a village or a unit that
can cure.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Heals +8
</span></dt><dd>
  This unit combines herbal remedies with magic to heal units more quickly
than is normally possible on the battlefield.  A unit cared for by this
healer may heal up to 8 HP per turn, or stop poison from taking effect for
that turn.  A poisoned unit cannot be cured of its poison by a healer, and
must seek the care of a village or a unit that can cure.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Illuminates
</span></dt><dd>
  This unit illuminates the surrounding area, making lawful units fight
better, and chaotic units fight worse.  Any units adjacent to this unit will
fight as if it were dusk when it is night, and as if it were day when it is
dusk.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Leadership
</span></dt><dd>
  This unit can lead friendly units that are next to it, making them fight
better.  Adjacent friendly units of lower level will do more damage in
battle.  When a unit adjacent to, of a lower level than, and on the same
side as a unit with Leadership engages in combat, its attacks do 25% more
damage times the difference in their levels.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Nightstalk
</span></dt><dd>
  The unit becomes invisible during night.  Enemy units cannot see this unit
at night, except if they have units next to it. Any enemy unit that first
discovers this unit immediately loses all its remaining movement.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Regenerates

Zones of Control.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Steadfast
</span></dt><dd>

defending. Vulnerabilities are not affected.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
Submerge
</span></dt><dd>
  This unit can hide in deep water, and remain undetected by its enemies.
Enemy units cannot see this unit while it is in deep water, except if they
have units next to it. Any enemy unit that first discovers this unit
immediately loses all its remaining movement.

Teleport
</span></dt><dd>
  This unit may teleport between any two friendly villages using one of its
moves.

number of strikes may be made with each weapon. For instance, an Elvish
Fighter does 5 points of damage with its sword every time it hits, and can
strike 4 blows with the sword in one exchange. This is written as 5×4,
meaning 5 damage per hit, and 4 strikes.</p><p>Every unit has a chance of being hit based on the terrain it is in. For

your chances of killing them.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_healing"></a>2.6. Healing</h2></div></div></div><p>A unit may be healed a maximum of 8 hit-points per turn. A unit that does
not move or fight during a turn is <span class="emphasis"><em>resting</em></span> and will
recover 2 hit-points. Hit-points recovered through
<span class="emphasis"><em>resting</em></span> are added on top of hit-points recovered
through healing so it is possible for a unit to recover up to a total of 10
hit-points per turn.</p><p>There are two basic ways for a unit to be healed:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
Waiting in a village. The unit will heal 8 hit-points every turn.
</li><li class="listitem">
Being adjacent to units with the <span class="emphasis"><em>heals</em></span> ability. The
number of hit-points healed is specified in the unit’s ability
description. This is invariably <span class="emphasis"><em>heals +4</em></span> or
<span class="emphasis"><em>heals +8</em></span>.
</li></ul></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_regeneration"></a>2.6.1. Regeneration</h3></div></div></div><p>Trolls and Woses have the ability to heal themselves naturally through
regeneration. They will heal 8 points each turn if they are injured. Note
that because all units may only heal a maximum of 8 points per turn, Trolls
and Woses gain no additional benefit from being on a village or next to a
healing unit.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_poison"></a>2.6.2. Poison</h3></div></div></div><p>Some attacks can inflict poison damage on your unit. When this happens the
poisoned unit will take 8 damage each turn until it is cured. Poison can be
cured by waiting on a village or being next to a unit with the
<span class="emphasis"><em>cures</em></span> ability. Units with the
<span class="emphasis"><em>heals</em></span> ability can only prevent the poison from causing
damage that turn, not cure it. When poison is cured the unit does not gain
or lose hit-points on that turn due to healing/poisoning. A unit cannot be
healed normally until it is cured of poisoning. Resting is still allowed,
although it will not substantially diminish the poison’s effect.</p><p>Some other hints about healing:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
A unit may take several turns to be fully healed.

off your career as a Wesnothian battle veteran. The minor concrete examples
are somewhat tied to the "Heir to the Throne" campaign.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_don_8217_t_waste_units"></a>3.1.1. Don’t waste units</h3></div></div></div><p>Do not send wounded units to a sure death. Once a unit loses more than half
of its hit points (HP), you should seriously consider retreating it to
safety and either station it in a village for healing or give him to the
care of a healer (like Elvish Shamans or White Mages). Healers are very
useful!</p><p>This is for practical reasons: a heavily wounded unit cannot hold back or
kill the enemy. During attack and counter-attack, it most often will
perish. Further, by sending it to its sure death, its gathered experience
points (XP) are lost. Recruiting a replacement may be impossible because the
leader is not in its keep or because funds are running low. Even if you can
recruit a replacement, it is most often far away from the battle front. So
don’t waste your units.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_out_of_the_enemy_8217_s_reach"></a>3.1.2. Out of the enemy’s reach</h3></div></div></div><p>How do you guard wounded units? They are best guarded by being out of the
adversary’s reach. No enemy can attack them if enemies cannot even
come near them. The next section about zone of control (ZOC) shows how to
restrict the enemy’s moves.</p><p>In the Action menu, you can select "Show Enemy Moves" to highlight all
possible hexes your adversary can actually move to. This takes your zone of
control into account. Thus you can check that your near death unit, which is
behind, indeed cannot be attacked as the enemy cannot move close to it.</p><p>When your armies meet, you may want to try to be the first to attack. So try
to end your move out of striking range of the enemy army. He cannot attack
but most likely will close into your striking range.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="zoc"></a>3.1.3. Shield with your zone of control (ZOC)</h3></div></div></div><p>Every unit of level 1 or higher maintains a zone of control (ZOC) covering
all 6 neighbouring hexes. This means that once an enemy moves into one of
the six neighbouring tiles, it is forced to halt and its movement phase ends
(only enemies with the rare skirmisher ability ignore this).</p><p>Because of ZOC, an enemy may not slip between two units which are aligned on
a north-south or diagonal line and have exactly 1 or 2 hexes between
them. By combining these pairs into a long wall or using them in different
directions, you can prevent the enemy from reaching a wounded unit
behind. He has to defeat the units imposing the ZOC first. If the enemy can
barely reach it, even a single unit may shield a small region behind itself.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_maintain_a_defensive_line"></a>3.1.4. Maintain a defensive line</h3></div></div></div><p>By lining up many units directly adjacent or with at most 1 hex space
between them, you can build a powerful defensive line. Note that, because
Wesnoth uses hexes, a east-to-west "line" is not a straight line but a
zig-zag curve. The north-south line and the diagonals are the "real" lines.</p><p>Coming from one side, the enemy may attack any single of your units in the
line with only 2 of his units at a time. As a rule of thumb, a healthy unit
without particular weakness can withstand an attack from two normal enemy
units of the same level or lower without getting killed.</p><p>Unfortunately, your line often has to bend to form a wedge or to fit the
terrain. At these corner points, 3 enemy units may attack. This also happens
at the ends of a line if the line is too short. Use units with high
hit-points on proper terrain or with proper resistances to hold these weak
points. These are the most likely to be killed, so use units with no or few
experience points (XP) for this purpose.</p><p>Lining your troops up also prevents the enemy from surrounding any one of
them. For ZOC reasons, a unit with one enemy behind it and one in front is
trapped.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_rotate_your_troops"></a>3.1.5. Rotate your troops</h3></div></div></div><p>When a unit in the front line is heavily damaged you can move him safely
behind your defensive line. To hold up the line, you will most likely have
to replace him with a reserve, so hold a couple of units in back of the
front line. If you have healers, damaged units in the second line will
quickly recover.</p><p>Note that your units can pass through hexes containing your own troops.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_use_the_terrain"></a>3.1.6. Use the terrain</h3></div></div></div><p>Try to position your troops so that they are attacking from a hex with high
defence against an enemy in a hex with low terrain. That way, the
enemy’s counter-strikes will be less likely to do damage.</p><p>For example, you might position your elves just inside of a forest edge so
that attacking orcs must stand on grassland while your elves enjoy the high
forest defences.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_attacking_and_choosing_your_targets"></a>3.1.7. Attacking and choosing your targets</h3></div></div></div><p>Advancing and attacking is of course the most interesting part of your way
to victory. Kill or weaken enemies in your path and move your defensive line
forward. This can become tricky as the enemy may retaliate on his turn.</p><p>Often, you will throw several units at a single enemy unit to finish him
off, but these were forming your defensive line which is now partly
broken. Maybe this doesn’t matter because you are out of reach of the
next enemy unit. Maybe it does because you only managed to weaken a very
strong enemy and next turn, he is going to strike back. Perhaps a Horseman
can deliver the killing blow.</p><p>Striking first is an advantage because it allows you the choice of which
units will face off. Take advantage of enemy weakness: e.g. direct your
ranged attacks against foes without ranged weapons. Take advantage of
weaknesses like Horsemen’s vulnerability to pierce. But remember that
they may retaliate on their turn, so you might have weaknesses the enemy may
exploit.</p><p>For example, Horsemen can hold up the line against Orcish Grunts and Troll
Whelps very well because they have some resistances against blade and
impact. But your Horseman may quite quickly fall to Orcish Archers and
Goblin Spearmen.</p><p>It usually pays off if you can definitively kill (or almost kill) the faced
unit. If you are unsure of finishing off the enemy in one turn, either
ensure that your unit can weather the return attacks or decide that
you’re willing to lose that unit. To withstand the enemy’s
strikes next turn, it is often wise to attack at the range that allows the
enemy to do least damage to you, rather than choosing the maximum expected
damage to the enemy.</p><p>In particular, use your ranged weapons if the enemy has no ranged
attack. Using it will often reduce the damage which your units take until
the enemy dies.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_time_of_day"></a>3.1.8. Time of Day</h3></div></div></div><p>Remember that Lawful units like humans fight better at daytime, Chaotic
units like orcs or undead fight better at night, and Liminal units fight
best during the twilight. Ideally you want to first meet the enemy when you
are strong and/or he is weak. When the enemy has its strong time, it often
pays off to strengthen your lines and hold a favourable defensive
position. When its weak time is about to arise, your advance will push
forth.</p><p>For example, elves might hold out a forest during a nightly orcish onslaught
and advance on sunrise. You may even note that the computer AI actively
retreats his orcs during day.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_experience_2"></a>3.1.9. Experience</h3></div></div></div><p>Over the course of a campaign, it is critical that you build a seasoned
force. Later scenarios will assume you have level 2 and 3 units available
for recall.</p><p>Your units gain most experience points (XP) from killing an enemy unit (8XP
per level of the unit killed). As such, it often makes sense to have your
higher level units weaken an enemy, but cede the kill to a unit more in need
of the XP. Healers in particular are often weak in combat and often need to
<span class="emphasis"><em>steal</em></span> kills in this way to advance levels.</p><p>At the beginning (when you probably have no high level units), try to give
most kills to a small handful of your units. This will fast-track them to
becoming Level 2 units, and they can then shepherd others.</p><p>Don’t neglect to earn your leader experience. You need to keep him
safe, but if you coddle him too much he will be too low level to survive
future scenarios anyway.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_getting_the_most_fun_out_of_the_game"></a>3.2. Getting the Most Fun Out of the Game</h2></div></div></div><p>Remember, the idea of a game is to have fun! Here are some recommendations
from the development team on how to get the most fun out of the game:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
Consider playing the campaign on "Medium" difficulty level, especially if
you have prior experience with strategy games. We feel you’ll find it
much more rewarding.
</li><li class="listitem">
Don’t sweat it too much when you lose some units. The campaign was
designed to accommodate the player losing some units along the way.
</li><li class="listitem">
Don’t abuse saved games. Long ago, Wesnoth only allowed saving the
game at the end of a scenario. Mid-scenario saving was added as a
convenience to use if you had to continue the game another day, or to
protect against crashes. We do not recommend loading mid-scenario saved
games over and over because your White Mage keeps getting killed. Learn to
protect your White Mage instead, and balance risks! That is part of the
strategy.
</li><li class="listitem">
If you must load a saved game, we recommend going back to the start of the
scenario, so that you choose a new strategy that works, rather than simply
finding random numbers that favour you.
</li><li class="listitem">
But remember, the aim is to have fun! You may have different tastes than the
developers, so do what you enjoy most! If you enjoy loading the saved game
every time you make a mistake, looking for the <span class="emphasis"><em>perfect</em></span>
game where you never lose a unit, by all means, go right ahead!
</li></ul></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_at_the_start_of_a_scenario"></a>3.2.1. At the start of a scenario</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
First, read the scenario objectives. Sometimes you do not have to kill enemy
leaders; instead it is enough that you survive for a certain number of
turns, or pick up a particular object.
</li><li class="listitem">
Look at the map: the terrain, the position of your leader and the other
leader(s).
</li><li class="listitem">
Then, begin to recruit units. Cheap units are useful to soak up the first
wave of an enemy’s attack; advanced units can then be brought in as
support. Fast units can be used as scouts, for exploring the map and to
quickly conquer villages.

Try to capture and keep control of as many villages as possible to keep the

Keep units in packs so the enemy cannot attack from as many sides, and so
you can outnumber each enemy unit. Put your units in a line so that the
enemy cannot attack any one of your units from more than two sides.

enemy. E.g. you can use them to block enemies reaching your important units.
</li><li class="listitem">
You can cause damage to enemies with advanced units and then finish them
with lower level units — to give them more experience (and finally make them
advance to the next level).
</li><li class="listitem">
When you have a White Mage (advances from Mage) or Druid (advances from
Shaman), put it in the middle of a circle of units to heal them as they move
across the map (Shamans can do this too, but not as well).
</li><li class="listitem">
Losing units is expected, even advanced units.

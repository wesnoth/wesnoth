<Kaleh and friend see keep; dialogue>

<They move further south; spawn Elves and Mudcrawlers; moar dialogue>

<They move even further south; moar Elves and moar Mudcrawlers; moar dialogue>

<They move to the east; moar Elves; new friend (Garak); moar Mudcrawlers; moar dialogue>

<They move to the west; they cross bridge; they go to center of island; new friend (Zhul); two Elvish Shamans; watered-down Cuttlefish; moar dialogue>

<They move to the west; they enter stable; they get Elvish Rider; moar dialogue>

<They get another rider by going into the second stable; moar dialogue>

<By doing that or waiting for a while, a mean Dark Sorcerer/Necromancer comes along and starts killing everyone :( even people in the outer villages :( ; even moar dialogue>

    Possibilities:

       - Put the DS/Necromancer's castle initially offmap and reveal it when the DS/Necromancer is supposed to be revealed
       - Randomize the location of the castle ('twould still end up in the top part)

<By entering the outer villages, our heroes may find an Elf... or nothing; definitely nothing if undead units already captured the villages; moar dialogue>

<Heroes kill meanie; undead die; moar dialogue>

<By killing meanie/waiting for a while, a hunting party arrives... yay>

<If meanie is dead and our heroes rescued everyone, they win... yay>

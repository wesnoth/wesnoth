 * NOTE: This class is broken and you probably shouldn't use it. Calling a save

 * functions throw exceptions. For example if the user decides to quit the game,
 * or there is a filesystem error. If the destructor throws exceptions, it will
 * cause memory leaks and crashes.
 * https://wiki.wesnoth.org/CodingStandards#Destructors_must_not_throw_exceptions
 *
 * As a temporary fix the destructor has been changed to swallow all exceptions.
 * However this means that if the user attempts to quit the game from the savegame
 * dialog, or any filesystem error occurs, it will be suppressed instead of being
 * handled normally. So you should avoid using this class and it may be removed.

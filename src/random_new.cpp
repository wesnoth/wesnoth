	 *  Using that code would be ideal, except that boost, and C++11, do not
	 *  guarantee that it will work the same way on all platforms, or that the 
	 *  results may not be different in future versions of the library.
	 *  The simplified version I have written should work the same on all
	 *  platforms, which is the most important thing for us.
	 *  The existence of "modulo bias" seems less important when we have moved
	 *  to boost::mt19937, since it guarantees that there are no "bad bits"
	 *  and has a very large range.
	 *
	 *  If a standard cross platform version becomes available then this should
	 *  be replaced.

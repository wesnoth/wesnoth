 * The default application for handling the object represented by

 * under which Wesnoth is running, and it is not under our control. Therefore,
 * <b>EXTREME CAUTION</b> is advised when using this function with URLs or
 * paths that are entirely or partially constructed from user-provided input
 * (e.g., WML from user-made add-ons, chat log messages).
 *
 * If the content pointed to by @a path_or_url cannot be trusted, you should
 * either refrain from using this function, or warn the user before calling
 * this function.
 *
 * @note Currently, only X11, Apple OS X, and Microsoft Windows are supported.
 *       Using this function on unsupported platforms will result in an error
 *       message logged in stderr.
 *
 * @return @a true on success, @a false otherwise. Failure to perform the
 *         platform call means either that we do not currently support the
 *         running platform, the child process exited with a non-zero status,
 *         or something else went wrong. Thus, a value of @a true does not
 *         truly guarantee success -- take it with a grain of salt.

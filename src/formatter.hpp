/**
 * std::ostringstream wrapper.
 *
 * ostringstream's operator<< doesn't return a ostringstream&. It returns an
 * ostream& instead. This is unfortunate, because it means that you can't do
 * something like this: (ostringstream() << n).str() to convert an integer to a
 * string, all in one line instead you have to use this far more tedious
 * approach:
 *  ostringstream s;
 *  s << n;
 *  s.str();
 * This class corrects this shortcoming, allowing something like this:
 *  string result = (formatter() << "blah " << n << x << " blah").str();

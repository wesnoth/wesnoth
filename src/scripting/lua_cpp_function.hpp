/**
 * This namespace makes the possibility to push not just C style functions,
 * but CPP style functions to lua, if they are cast as a std::function.
 * Using this, for example, C++ method functions may be std::bind'ed and
 * then pushed into the lua environment and called like usual.
 *
 * They are represented as user data with a call operator, which uses a
 * dispatcher implemented as a C-style function to retrieve the boost
 * function and execute it. Thus effectively all that we have to provide
 * is a "value type" user data (full userdata, not light userdata) in lua
 * which wraps the std::function type and implements a garbage collector.
 *
 *
 * -- Why? --
 *
 * There are a few basic approaches to connect lua and C++, with various
 * degrees of power. Lua, being a C library, has no concept of C++ specific
 * types, even when compiled as C++. Lua has only two functions which
 * introduce C functions to the scripting environment:
 * lua_pushcfunction, and lua_pushcclosure. (The helper library only provides
 * functions which use these.) These functions can only accept C-style function
 * pointers of type int (lua_State*). Boost bind cannot be used to make a match
 * to this type signature, nor can C++ method functions be used.
 *
 * In many cases C-style functions are sufficient, but if one ever wants to
 * refer to an instance of a class or a member variable (which one does as most
 * of our project is written in C++ object oriented style), it's not enough.
 *
 * The basic lua-provided approach to this is to pass objects as "userdata".
 * Userdata comes in two flavors, "regular" and "light", for representing
 * value and reference types respectively. Lightuserdata is meant to hold a
 * pointer to an object -- full userdata is meant to hold an instance of an
 * object which is either copied with memcpy or constructed using placement new.
 * Proper memory management may require using lua's __gc metamethod to call a
 * destructor. In the normal idiom, every class which is passed to lua this
 * way should have C-function shim provided for each method which may be called
 * by lua -- the object's "this" is retrieved from the userdata type on the
 * stack, and used to call the appopriate method. A metatable is defined, which
 * may be the same as the "lua module" placed in the global namespace which may
 * also provide access to a constructor.
 *
 * This approach is often quite good for small objects. Wesnoth uses full userdata
 * to represent "rng" objects used in lua random map generation, to represent lua
 * "private units", to represent vconfigs and translatable strings. Wesnoth uses
 * lightuserdata for many AI related objects.
 *
 * However it is not ideal for "large" objects like the game engine itself or its
 * helpers. In this case full translation to userdata is out of the question --
 * in case of lightuserdata, it is problematic because the lua api is not actually
 * trying to directly represent a wesnoth engine object (which doesn't exist!)
 * the wesnoth table in lua instead has a medley of callbacks implemented variously
 * by grabbing from the gamemap, the unit map, the game_config namespace, etc. etc.
 * for instance even the wesnoth.game_config table is not backed up by any one object,
 * instead its callbacks may variously alter game_config namespace or the current tod
 * manager object etc. etc.
 *
 * Circa 2012, the solution was to implement every callback function in the wesnoth
 * table simply as a C function, which grabs whatever engine features it needs from
 * a collection of pointers with external linkage in resources.hpp. The pointers
 * must be reset by the play controller object whenever it is created or destroyed...
 * or reset (replay controller), and always in a particular order because eventually
 * all of the objects themselves are also grabbing these pointers, leading to segfaults
 * if they are initialized in the wrong order, or left with danging pointers...
 * in short it was very messy. While the organization of everything as pure C functions
 * allows us to flexibly organize the wesnoth table using subtables holding functions
 * as we like, (which wouldn't be possible if it were based on a lightuserdata), the
 * requirement to base it all on externally-linked pointer variables comes at great cost.
 * Further it means that we can never hope to have a correct deep-copy constructor of the
 * gamestate, meaning that features like "replay moves since my last turn" or "AI based
 * on exploratory simulations" are much more difficult to produce if not impossible.
 *
 * The lua cpp functions code permits us to refactor this by (1) passing all the engine
 * resources needed by the lua environment, to the "lua kernel" at construction time,
 * which holds them as private variables (2) declaring all callbacks which need these
 * as private member functions (3) using boost bind to bind them to the lua kernel and
 * this code to push the result into the scripting environment, at construction time
 * of the lua kernel. Now there is no longer any question about dangling pointers in lua,
 * or issues about making deep copies, since a lua state may be copied and the pointers
 * in the kernel rebound, and the pointers in lua all die when the kernel is destroyed.
 *
 * More generally, this code makes it easy to assemble "mixins" for lua using the member
 * functions of several different classes, if this is desired.
 *
 * The implementation details are also extremely simple -- whereas there are many popular
 * lua -> C++ binding utilities like LuaPlus, luabind, etc. many of these only truly
 * support automatic generation of bindings for *all* of the methods of an object, rely
 * on the userdata approach, and require substantial template metaprogramming which will
 * turn up in any associated stacktraces. This technique used here essentially delegates
 * all of the templating work to boost, and is implemented in only a few hundred lines.
 *
 *
 * -- Caveats: --
 *
 * Essentially, we provide C++ versions of the lua library calls 'lua_pushcfunction',
 * 'lua_setfuncs', 'lua_pushcclosure'.
 *
 * - They are "C++" versions in that they take std::function<int (lua_State*)> rather
 * than int(lua_State*).
 * - While for lua, "lua_pushcfunction(L, f)" is essentially the same as
 * "lua_pushcclosure(L, f, 0)", for the functions below that is not the case.
 * lua_cpp::push_function generates a userdata "helper" object with a _call operator,
 * not technically a function. lua_cpp::push_closure generates a true lua closure.
 * Therefore push_closure is the most general and most compatible form -- push_function
 * is slightly simpler and more efficient though.
 * - Similarly lua_cpp::set_functions(L, l) differs from lua_cpp::set_functions(L,l,nups).
 * - Closures created by lua_cpp::push_closure are not *exactly* the same as lua closures,
 * in that the first upvalue is used by the implementation. A closure created with two
 * upvalues will find them at upvalue indices 2 and 3, and should not touch upvalue 1.

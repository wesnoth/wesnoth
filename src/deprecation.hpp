/**
 * Prints a message to the deprecation log domain informing players that a given feature
 * has been deprecated.
 *
 * @param elem_name    The name of the feature to be deprecated.
 * @param level        The deprecation level. This indicates how long the feature will
 *                     remain supported before removal.
 * @param version      If @a level is PREEMPTIVE or FOR_REMOVAL, this should be the first
 *                     version in which the feature could be removed. If it's INDEFINITE
 *                     or REMOVED, this is unused.
 * @param detail       Optional extra message elaborating on the deprecation. This can be
 *                     used to specify which feature to use instead, for example.
 *
 * @returns            The final translated deprecation message in case you want to output
 *                     it elsewhere as well.
 *
 * @todo               @a version should probably be made optional to handle INDEFINITE
 *                     and REMOVED deprecation, but I don't think we can do that without
 *                     including version_info.hpp in this header.

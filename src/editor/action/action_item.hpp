/**
 * @file
 * Editor action classes. Some important points:
 * - This is a polymorphic hierarchy of classes, so actions are usually passed around
 *   as editor_action pointers
 * - The pointers can, in general, be null. Always check for null before doing anything.
 *   The helper functions perform_ that take a pointer do that.
 * - The perform() functions can throw when an error occurs. Use smart pointers if you
 *   need to ensure the pointer is deleted.

		Sets the context to 'synced', initialises random context, and calls the given function.
		The plan is that in replay and in real game the same function is called.
		however, if you cannot call this function you can also use set_scontext_synced directly (use it like it's used in this method).

		movement commands are currently treated specially, 
			thats because actions::move_unit returns a value and some function use that value.
			maybe i should add a way here to return a value.
		
		ai's attacks are also treated special because the ai wants to pass advancement_aspects.


		redoing does normaly not take place in a synced context, because we saved the dependent=true replaycommands in the replaystack data. 
			also there are no events of similar fired when redoing an action (in most cases).
		
		@param use_undo this parameter is used to ignore undos during an ai move to optimize.
		@param store_in_replay only true if called by do_replay_handle
		@param error_handler an error handler for the case that data contains invalid data.
		
		@return true if the action was successful.

/**
 * Wrapper class that guarantees that file commit atomicity.
 *
 * It is possible for a signal or exception to cause a file write to be aborted
 * in the middle of the process, leaving potentially inconsistent contents
 * behind which may be read by the same or another application later and result
 * in errors or further data loss.
 *
 * This wrapper prevents this by providing callers with an interface to request
 * a write stream that will be actually associated to a temporary file. Once
 * the caller is done with the file, it should call the commit() method to
 * complete the process so that the temporary replaces the original in an
 * atomic step.
 *
 * The rationale for using an explicit commit() method instead of the class
 * destructor is that the destructor will also be invoked during exception
 * handling, which could still cause the destination file to end up in an
 * inconsistent state.
 *
 * Note that if the destructor is invoked before commit() is, the temporary
 * file will be left behind. This is deliberate so as to provide a way for
 * the user to look at the resulting file and optionally try to reconcile it
 * against the original.

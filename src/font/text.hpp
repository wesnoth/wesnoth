/**
 * Text class.
 *
 * This class represents text which is rendered using Pango.
 *
 * It takes text, as a utf-8 std::string, plus formatting options including
 * font and color. It provides a surface object which holds the rendered text.
 *
 * Besides this, it can do some additional calculations using the font layout.
 *
 * It can take an index into the text, and convert it to pixel coordinates,
 * so that if we want to draw a cursor in an editbox, we know where to draw it.
 *
 * It can also take a pixel coordinate with respect to the text layout, and
 * translate it back to an index into the original text. This is useful if the
 * user clicks on the text, and we want to know where to move the cursor.
 *
 * The get_token method takes a pixel coordinate, which we assume represents a
 * click position, and gets the corresponding "token" from the string. The default
 * token delimiters are whitespace " \n\r\t". So, this returns the "word" that the
 * user clicked on.
 *
 * Finally, the get_link method represents special support for hyperlinks in text.
 * A token "looks like a link" if it begins "http://" or "https://".
 * If a text has link_aware enabled, then any such token is rendered with an
 * underline and in a special color, see `link_color`.
 * The get_link method calls get_token and further checks if the clicked token
 * looks like a link.
 *
 * This class stores the text to draw and uses pango with the cairo backend to
 * render the text. See http://pango.org for more info.

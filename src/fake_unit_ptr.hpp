	Temporary units can overlap units.
	They are drawn after the normal units, and so draw over them.
	Adding the same unit twice isn't allowed.
	The fake_unit privately holds a referenced counted point to its underlying unit,
	when it goes out of scope it removes the entry from the fake_units list.
	The intent is to provide exception safety when the code
	creating the temp unit is unexpectedly forced out of scope.

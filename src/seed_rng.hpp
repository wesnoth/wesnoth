   This file provides a name space to store a source for seeds for
   prgs. It should be boost::random_device on platforms that provide
   this with our version of boost random, and otherwise should be the
   system time I suppose.

   The seed_rng::next_seed function provided probably shouldn't be used
   anywhere except for default constructors of prg classes, or similar.

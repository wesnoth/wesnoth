/*
**  Wesnoth Lua Configuration
**
**  If at all possible, Wesnoth should use the stock, unmodified Lua source
**  kit.
**
**  This file contains the cross-platform compile-time changes. Platform
**  maintainers should consult wesnoth_lua_config.md for guidance on building
**  Lua for Wesnoth on their platform using their toolset.
**
**  Lua comes with a number of configuration options, such as backward
**  compatibility with earlier versions. In the original source kit, the
**  intention is these be set as compile-time options. For Wesnoth, place
**  them here to better ensure consistency.
**
**  In addition, there are specific non-standard changes which Wesnoth
**  requires. Those changes, if at all possible, should appear here. This
**  will reduce (hopefully, actually eliminate) any changes to the Lua
**  source kit. If that is not possible, be sure to describe the changes
**  needed, including a brief rationale and commit hashes, in
**  wesnoth_lua_config.md

/*  We canNOT use strcoll on Windows!
 *
 *  All strings in Wesnoth are UTF-8 encoded. On Windows, strcoll assumes
 *  strings are UTF-16LE encoded; using strcoll will cause the strings to
 *  collate in a different order than on all other targets. This can cause
 *  OOS errors during networked multi-player games.

 *
 *  The stock Lua catch(...) consumes the exception. We need to re-throw
 *  it so. This allows the inner function (in C++ -> Lua -> C++) to pass
 *  back information about the exception, instead of reclassifying all
 *  exceptions to a single Lua status code.

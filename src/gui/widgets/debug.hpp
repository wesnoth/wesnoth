 * containing the graphs. This is used for debugging the widget library and its
 * sizing algorithm.
 *
 * This class needs to be friends with a lot of classes so it can view the
 * private data in the class. This design is chosen so the debug info can be
 * put in a separate class instead of adding the info via virtual functions in
 * the classes themselves. Also adding 'friend class foo' doesn't need to
 * include the header declaring foo, so it avoids header cluttage.

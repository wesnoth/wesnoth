 * static functions. The goal is to have less header recompilations, when
 * there's a need to add or remove a private function.
 * Also non-trivial functions like 'const foo& bar() const' and 'foo& bar()'
 * are wrapped in a template to avoid code duplication (for typing not for the
 * binary) to make maintenance easier.

/**
 * A top-level drawable item (TLD), such as a window.
 *
 * For now, TLDs keep track of where they are on the screen on their own.
 * They must draw themselves when requested via expose().
 *
 * The TLD interface will be called in the following order:
 *   - update()
 *   - layout()
 *   - render()
 *   - screen_location()
 *   - zero or more expose() calls
 *
 * It can be assumed that events will have been processed before TLD
 * interface calls commence, and that no more events will be processed
 * until all TLD interfaces have been called. As such the main program
 * loop will usually be:
 *   1. process events
 *   2. call update() on all TLDs
 *   3. call layout() on all TLDs
 *   4. call render() on all TLDs
 *   5. call expose() on TLDs as appropriate
 *
 * TLDs are responsible for propagating these calls to their children.
 *
 * This process is loosely based on the GTK drawing model. Ref:
 *   - https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/drawing-model.html
 *   - https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/drawing-model.html

 * * For every visible child item call @ref add_item() with the wanted size of
 *   the widget.
 * Once this is done the required size for all children can be retrieved with
 * @ref get_size(). It is also possible to place all children now. In order to
 * do so loop again over all children in the same order as @ref add_item() and
 * call @ref get_origin(). The @p index parameter is an increasing counter.
 *
 * @note The origins can only be retrieved after all items are added since the
 * adding of a later item may influence a previous item. E.g. in a vertical
 * list with two columns the position of the second column depends on the width
 * of the first and a later row may have a wider column 1 as an earlier row.

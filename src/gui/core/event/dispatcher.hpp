	 * * pre_child These callbacks are called before a container widget sends it
	 *   to the child items. Widgets without children should also use this
	 *   queue.
	 * * child The callbacks for the proper child widget(s) are called.
	 * * post_child The callbacks for the parent container to be called after
	 *   the child.
	 *
	 * For every queue it's possible to add a new event in the front or in the
	 * back.
	 *
	 * Whether all three queues are executed depend on the whether the
	 * callbacks modify the handled and halt flag.
	 * * When the halt flag is set execution of the current queue stops, when
	 *   doing so the handled flag must be set as well.
	 * * When the handled flag is set the events in that queue are executed and
	 *   no more queues afterwards.
	 *
	 * Here are some use case examples.
	 * A button that plays a sound and executes an optional user callback:
	 * * The buttons internal click handler is invoked and sets the handled
	 *   flag
	 * * The callback installed by the user is in the same queue and gets
	 *   executed afterwards.
	 *
	 * A toggle button may or may not be toggled:
	 * * The user inserts a callback, that validates whether the action is
	 *   allowed, if not allowed it sets the halt flag (and handled), else
	 *   leaves the flags untouched.
	 * * The normal buttons toggle function then might get invoked and if so
	 *   sets the handled flag.
	 * * Optionally there is another user callback invoked at this point.

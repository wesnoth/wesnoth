 * @page event_dispatching Event dispatching.
 *
 * @section introduction Introduction
 *
 * This page describes how the new event handling system works, since the
 * system is still work in progress it might be out of date with the actual
 * code. It also contains some ideas that might change later on. Some parts are
 * explained in the interface and will be integrated in this document later.
 *
 * Since the event handling code hasn't been cast in stone yet some scenarios
 * for solving the problem are discussed first and then the solution that is
 * chosen in more detail.
 *
 * After SDL has generated and event it needs to be turned into an event which
 * the widgets can use.
 *
 * @section handling_solution The implementation solutions.
 *
 * For the event handling we use a few use case scenarios and show the possible
 * solutions.
 *
 * @subsection sample The sample window
 *
 * In our samples we use this sample window with the following components:
 * - a window W
 * - a container C
 * - a button B
 *
 * These are arranged accordingly:
 * @code
 *
 *   ---------------------
 *  |W                     |
 *  |                      |
 *  |  -----------------   |
 *  | |C              |^|  |
 *  | |               |-|  |
 *  | |  ----------   |#|  |
 *  | | |B         |  | |  |
 *  | |  ----------   | |  |
 *  | |               |-|  |
 *  | |               |v|  |
 *  |  -----------------   |
 *  |                      |
 *   ---------------------
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsection scenarios Possible scenarios
 *
 * The scenarios are:
 * - An event that is wanted by none.
 * - A mouse down event that should focus C and set the pressed state in B.
 * - A mouse wheel event, which first should be offered to B and if not handled
 *   by B should be handled by C.
 *
 * @subsection all_queues Pass the event through all queues
 *
 * In this solution the event will be passed through all possible queues and
 * tries sees where the event sticks. This following sections describe how the
 * events are tried for this usage scenario.
 *
 * @subsubsection unhandled Unhandled event
 *
 * - W pre child
 * - C pre child
 * - B pre child
 * - W child
 * - C child
 * - B child
 * - W post child
 * - C post child
 * - B post child
 *
 * @subsubsection mouse_down Mouse down
 *
 * - W pre child
 * - C pre child -> set focus -> !handled
 * - B pre child -> set pressed state -> handled
 *
 * @subsubsection mouse_wheel Mouse wheel
 *
 * - W pre child
 * - C pre child
 * - B pre child -> We can't scroll so ignore
 * - W child
 * - C child
 * - B child
 * - W post child
 * - C post child -> Scroll -> handled
 *
 * @subsection chain Pass the events in a chain like fashion
 *
 * In this solution the events are send to the pre- and post queue of all but
 * the last possible widget and to the child of the last widget. The pre queue
 * will be send from top to bottom, the post queue from bottom to top.
 *
 * @subsubsection unhandled Unhandled event
 *
 * - W pre child
 * - C pre child
 * - B child
 * - C post child
 * - W post child
 *
 * @subsubsection mouse_down Mouse down
 *
 * - W pre child
 * - C pre child -> set focus -> !handled
 * - B child -> set pressed state -> handled
 *
 * @subsubsection mouse_wheel Mouse wheel
 *
 * - W pre child
 * - C pre child
 * - B child -> We can't scroll so ignore
 * - C post child -> Scroll -> handled
 *
 * @subsection evaluation Evaluation
 *
 * When using the first solution it's possible to drop the child queue since
 * everything falls in pre or post. But there is a scenario that's a bit ugly
 * to solve with the first solution:
 *
 * Assume there is a listbox with toggle panels and on the panel there are a
 * few buttons, the wanted behavior is:
 * - if clicked on the panel it should toggle, which may or may not be allowed.
 * - if clicked on a button in the panel, we want to make sure the panel is
 *   selected, which again may or may not be allowed.
 *
 * With solution 2 it's rather easy:
 *
 * Click on panel:
 * - W pre child
 * - C child -> Test whether we can toggle -> handled, halt = !toggled
 *
 * Click on button in panel:
 * - W pre child
 * - C pre child -> Test whether we can select -> handled = halt = !selected
 * - B child -> do button stuff -> handled
 *
 * Since for the different clicks, different queues are triggered it's easy to
 * add a different handler there.
 *
 * With solution 1:
 *
 * Click on panel:
 * - W pre child
 * - C pre child -> handler 1 -> if last in queue -> solution 2 C child
 *
 * Click on button in panel:
 * - W pre child
 * - C pre child -> handler 2 -> if !last in queue -> solution 2 C pre child
 * - B pre child -> do button stuff -> handled
 *
 * Not that different from solution 2, the two handlers are installed in the C
 * pre event. But we need to manually check whether we're really the last,
 * which means the code to check whether there are more handlers at a lower
 * level is needed for both solutions. In solution 1 this test needs to be done
 * twice versus once in solution 2. Also the fact that the queues for the
 * events are processed in reverse order on the way back sounds more
 * initiative.
 *
 * @section processing_raw_events Processing the raw events.
 *
 * This section describes how the events generated by SDL are send as our own
 * events to the various widgets. The first step in sending an event is to
 * decode it and send it to a registered dispatcher.
 *
 * - gui2::event::sdl_event_handler handles the SDL events.
 * - gui2::event::dispatcher has the registered dispatchers.
 *
 * In general a dispatcher is a window which then needs to send this event to
 * the widgets. The dispatcher is just a simple part which fires events and
 * finds a handler for the event. This is not to the liking of most widgets,
 * they don't want to handle raw events but get a polished and clean event. No
 * button up and down and then try to figure out whether it needs to act as if
 * it was clicked upon, no simply op and down to change the appearance and a
 * click event to do the clicking actions. And don't even try to convince a
 * widget to determine whether this up event was a single or double click.
 * Widgets like to sleep with nice dreams and not having nightmares where SDL
 * events haunt them.
 *
 * In order to remedy that problem there's the gui2::event::distributor
 * class, it's the class to do the dirty job of converting the raw event into
 * these nice polished events. The distributor is in general linked to a window,
 * but a widget can install it's own distributor if it needs to know more of the
 * raw events as still left in the polished events. At the time of this writing
 * no widget needs this feature, but the toggle panel might need it.
 *
 * After the distributor has polished the event and send it on its way to the
 * widget the dispatcher needs to make sure the event is properly dispatched to
 * the widget in question and also notify its parents by means of the previously
 * described event chain.
 *
 * @subsection sdl_event Get the SDL events
 *
 * The first step in event handling is getting the events in the first place.
 * Events are generated by SDL and placed in a queue. The Wesnoth code processes
 * this queue and thus handles the events. The part which does the first
 * handling isn't described here since it's (secretly) intended to be replaced
 * by the @ref gui2::event::sdl_event_handler class. Instead we directly jump to this
 * class and explain what it does.
 *
 * The main handling function is @ref gui2::event::sdl_event_handler::handle_event which
 * as no real surprise handles the events. The function is a simple multiplexer
 * which lets other subfunctions to the handling of specific events.
 *
 * @todo Describe drawing and resizing once the code is stable and working as
 * wanted in these areas.
 *
 * @subsubsection handler_mouse Mouse motion events
 *
 * If a dispatcher has captured the mouse it gets the event, no questions asked.
 * If not it goes through all dispatchers and finds the first one willing to
 * accept the mouse event.
 *
 * This means a mouse event is send to one dispatcher.
 *
 * @subsubsection handler_mouse_button_down Mouse button down events
 *
 * Turning the mouse wheel on a mouse generates both an down and up event. It
 * has been decided to handle the wheel event in the button up code so wheel
 * events are here directly dropped on the floor and forgotten.
 *
 * The other buttons are handled as if they're normal mouse events but are
 * decoded per button so instead of a button_down(id) you get button_down_id.
 *
 * @subsubsection handler_mouse_button_up Mouse button up events
 *
 * The mouse wheel event is handled as if it's a keyboard event and like the
 * button_down they are send as wheel_id events.
 *
 * The other mouse buttons are handled the same as the down buttons.
 *
 * @subsubsection handler_keyboard Keyboard events
 *
 * There are three types of keyboard events, the already mentioned mouse wheel
 * events, the key down and key up event. When a key is pressed for a longer
 * time several key down events are generated and only one key up, this means
 * the key up is rather useless. Guess what, the multiplexer already drops that
 * event so we never get it.
 *
 * If the keyboard event is a mouse wheel event it's directly send to the
 * dispachting queue; either the dispatcher that captured the keyboard or the
 * last dispatcher in the queue.
 *
 * If the event is a real keyboard action it's first tried as hotkey. In order
 * to do so the target dispatcher is first determined, either the dispatcher
 * that captured the keyboard or the last dispatcher in the queue. Then it's
 * tried whether a hotkey and whether the hotkey can be processed. If the
 * hotkey isn't processed the keyboard event is send to the dispatcher as
 * normal keyboard event.
 *
 * The hotkey processing will have several queues (to be implemented in 1.9):
 * - global hotkeys that always work eg toggling fullscreen mode.
 * - main screen hotkeys, these work when one of the dialogs is shown without
 *   other dialogs on top of them. These hotkeys are for example
 *   preferences. The main screens are:
 *   - title screen
 *   - game
 *   - editor
 *   - mp lobby
 * - map screen hotkeys, these work when a map is shown eg toggle grid. The
 *   screens are:
 *   - game
 *   - editor
 * - local hotkeys, these are hotkeys that only work in a specific dialog eg
 *   recruit unit only works in the game screen.
 *
 * The queues are processed in from bottom to top in the list above, this
 * allows an item to use a hotkey but have another handler function. Eg
 * preferences in the editor might open another preferences dialog.
 *
 * @todo The hotkeys need to be implemented like above in 1.9.
 *
 * @todo This might change in the near future.
 *
 * @subsection distributor Event polishing and distribution
 *
 * The event distributor has the job to find the widget that should receive the
 * event and which event(s) to send from a single event. In general an event is
 * first send to the widget as-is, sending the raw events allows other
 * distributors to be nested between this distributor and the intended target
 * widget. Or the intended widget might not really be the intended widget but
 * another distributor that wants to dispatch the event internally.
 *
 * However in the common cases this raw event isn't handled and the distributor
 * needs to send the polished events. In the following sections the details of
 * the conversion from raw to polished is described, it intentionally lacks the
 * part of sending the raw events as well since it adds no value.
 *
 * A widget can capture the mouse, which means all mouse events are send to this
 * widget, regardless where the mouse is. This is normally done in a mouse down
 * event (for a button) so all events following it are send to that widget.
 *
 * @subsection mouse_motion Mouse motion
 *
 * This section describes the conversion from a raw mouse motion to the polished
 * events it can generate:
 * - @ref gui2::event::MOUSE_ENTER "MOUSE_ENTER"
 * - @ref gui2::event::MOUSE_LEAVE "MOUSE_LEAVE"
 * - @ref gui2::event::MOUSE_MOTION "MOUSE_MOTION"
 *
 * When the mouse is captured that widget will only receive motion events.
 *
 * If not captured the code checks whether the widget underneath the mouse is
 * the same widget as at the last motion if event. If so that widget gets a
 * motion event.
 * If not the widget that before was underneath the mouse pointer (if any) gets
 * a leave event and the widget newly underneath the mouse pointer (if any) gets
 * an enter event.
 *
 * @subsection mouse_button Mouse buttons
 *
 * The mouse button code is a bit more complex and is separated in the various
 * events to be send.
 *
 * @subsubsection mouse_button_down Mouse button down
 *
 * Some things start simple, so does the event of pressing down a mouse button.
 * All it does is send the event to the widget as one of the following events:
 * - @ref gui2::event::LEFT_BUTTON_DOWN "LEFT_BUTTON_DOWN"
 * - @ref gui2::event::MIDDLE_BUTTON_DOWN "MIDDLE_BUTTON_DOWN"
 * - @ref gui2::event::RIGHT_BUTTON_DOWN "RIGHT_BUTTON_DOWN"
 *
 * @todo Validate the code it seems a down event with a captured mouse doesn't
 * really work as wanted. (Rare case but should work properly.) In general the
 * mouse event handling needs testing to see whether the proper events are send
 * all the time.
 *
 * @subsubsection mouse_button_up Mouse button up
 *
 * Simplicity ends here.
 *
 * @todo Document further.
 *
 * @subsubsection mouse_click Mouse click
 *
 * So the button up event has asked for mouse click, now we need to test whether
 * the click will be a click or a double click. A double click is generated when
 * the same widget is clicked twice in a short time and causes the following
 * events:
 * - @ref gui2::event::LEFT_BUTTON_DOUBLE_CLICK "LEFT_BUTTON_DOUBLE_CLICK"
 * - @ref gui2::event::MIDDLE_BUTTON_DOUBLE_CLICK "MIDDLE_BUTTON_DOUBLE_CLICK"
 * - @ref gui2::event::RIGHT_BUTTON_DOUBLE_CLICK "RIGHT_BUTTON_DOUBLE_CLICK"
 *
 * Otherwise one of the following single clicks is generated:
 * - @ref gui2::event::LEFT_BUTTON_CLICK "LEFT_BUTTON_CLICK"
 * - @ref gui2::event::MIDDLE_BUTTON_CLICK "MIDDLE_BUTTON_CLICK"
 * - @ref gui2::event::RIGHT_BUTTON_CLICK "RIGHT_BUTTON_CLICK"
 *
 * @subsubsection double_click To double click or not to double click
 *
 * Wait a second, a widget has a field whether or not it wants a double click
 * for a certain mouse button and now I see that it's bluntly ignored by the
 * distributor. Indeed the distributor doesn't care about what the widget wants,
 * it does what it wants and leaves the sorting out what's wanted to the
 * dispatcher.
 *
 * The problem is that in the chain events are send to one widget that may not
 * be interested in a double click, but another widget in the chain is. There
 * are several solutions to this problem:
 * -# Sending a click followed by a double click.
 * -# Sending a click with a tag field that it actually is a double click.
 * -# Send a double click and turn it into a click if the double click is
 *    unwanted.
 *
 * The first solution has the disadvantage that a toggle panel likes a click and
 * double click, the first click selects the second deselects and now the
 * deselected panel gets a double click. When the panel now checks whether it's
 * selected it's not and might take the wrong action upon it.
 *
 * The second option is possible but would be rather intrusive in the code,
 * since it would generate another event signature. Adding a signature just for
 * this special case seemed a bit too much effort vs. gain. Also the widget
 * needs to check whether a click is a click or a double click and choose a
 * different code path for it. This in turn would mean a signal handler
 * secretly might handle two events and lowers the transparency of the code.
 *
 * The third option also adds some special case handling but the scope is
 * limited and only one part knows about the tricks done.
 *
 * The last option has been chosen and the dispatcher build the event chain and
 * while building the chain it looks whether the widget wants the double click
 * or not. It does this test by looking at the wants double click function and
 * not test for a handler. The double click test function is made for this
 * purpose and depending on the handler might again do the wrong thing.
 * (A certain toggle panel might not want to do something on a double click but
 * also not being deselected upon a double click. The latter to keep the UI
 * consistent, a double click on a toggle panel might execute a special function
 * or not, but always keep the panel selected. (That is if the panel can be
 * selected.))

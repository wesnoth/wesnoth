/**
 * @file
 * Contains the gui2 timer routines.
 *
 * This code avoids the following problems with the sdl timers:
 * - the callback must be a C function with a fixed signature.
 * - the callback needs to push an event in the event queue, between the
 *   pushing and execution of that event the timer can't be stopped. (Makes
 *   sense since the timer has expired, but not what the user wants.)
 *
 * With these functions it's possible to remove the event between pushing in
 * the queue and the actual execution. Since the callback is a std::function
 * object it's possible to make the callback as fancy as wanted.

 * ------------------|------------------|---------|-----------
 * hour_percentage   | progress_bar     |no       |This shows the hours as a percentage, where 24 hours is 100%.
 * minute_percentage | progress_bar     |no       |This shows the minutes as a percentage, where 60 minutes is 100%.
 * second_percentage | progress_bar     |no       |This shows the seconds as a percentage, where 60 seconds is 100%.
 * hour              | integer_selector |no       |This shows the seconds since the beginning of the day. The control should have a minimum_value of 0 and a maximum_value of 86399 (246060 - 1).
 * minute            | integer_selector |no       |This shows the seconds since the beginning of the current hour. The control should have a minimum_value of 0 and a maximum_value of 3599 (6060 - 1).
 * second            | integer_selector |no       |This shows the seconds since the beginning of the current minute. The control should have a minimum_value of 0 and a maximum_value of 59.
 * clock             | control          |no       |A control which will have set three variables in its canvas:<ul><li>hour - the same value as the hour integer_selector.</li><li>minute - the same value as the minute integer_selector.</li><li>second - the same value as the second integer_selector.</li></ul>The control can then show the time in its own preferred format(s).

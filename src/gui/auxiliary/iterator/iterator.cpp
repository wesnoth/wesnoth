/**
 * @page gui2_iterator GUI2 Iterator.
 *
 * The iterator class allows the user to iterate over a group of widgets.
 * The idea is to add a visitor class later as well, where the two classes
 * can be combined.
 *
 * This page describes how the iterator class works. The iterator is build
 * from several parts:
 * - level, the part and subparts of the widget to visit.
 * - walker, iterates over a single widget at several levels.
 * - visit policy, whether a level should be visited or not.
 * - order policy, the order in which the several levels are traversed.
 * - iterator, the user interface for iteration.
 *
 *
 * @section gui2_iterator_level Level
 *
 * The levels are defined in @ref gui2::iteration::walker_base::level. The
 * level allows the user to only visit a part of the widget tree.
 *
 * @note At the moment when gui2::iteration::walker_base::widget is skipped the
 * child class also skips its children. This behavior might change.
 *
 *
 * @section gui2_iterator_walker Walker
 *
 * The is a group of classes inheriting from @ref gui2::iteration::walker_base
 * the objects are created from @ref gui2::widget::create_walker. The
 * walker allows to visit the several levels of the widget. This means
 * several widgets need to override the function in a subclass. For example
 * most @em simple widgets don't have a grid or children so they can use the
 * walker created from @ref gui2::styled_widget. But containers need to create a
 * different walker.
 *
 *
 * @section gui2_iterator_visit_policy Visit policy
 *
 * This policy simply defines whether or not to visit the widgets at a
 * certain level. There are two visit policies:
 * - @ref gui2::iteration::policy::visit::visit_level visits the widget at the level.
 * - @ref gui2::iteration::policy::visit::skip_level skips the widget at the level.
 *
 * There are no more visit policies expected for the future. These policies
 * are normally not used directly, but set from the @ref
 * gui2_iterator_order_policy.
 *
 *
 * @section gui2_iterator_order_policy Order policy
 *
 * This policy determines in which order the widgets are traversed, children
 * first, this level before diving down etc. @ref tests/gui/iterator.cpp
 * shows more information.
 * The following policies have been defined:
 * - @ref gui2::iteration::policy::order::top_down
 * - @ref gui2::iteration::policy::order::bottom_up
 *
 * The next sections describe in which order the widgets are visited. In the
 * description we use the following widget tree.
 *
 * [0]          @n
 *  \           @n
 *   [1|2|3|4]  @n
 *    \         @n
 *    [5|6|7|8] @n
 *
 * The types are:
 * - grid 0, 1
 * - styled_widget 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
 *
 * The examples assume all levels will be visited.
 *
 *
 * @subsection gui2_iterator_visit_policy_top_down Top down
 *
 * The widgets visited first is the initial widget. After that it tries to go
 * down to a child widget and will continue down. Once that fails it will visit
 * the siblings at that level before going up again.
 *
 * @todo Write the entire visiting algorithm.
 *
 * The visiting order in our example is:
 * 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, 3, 4
 *
 *
 * @subsection gui2_iterator_visit_policy_bottom_up Bottom up
 *
 * When the iterator is created the iterator tries to go down all the child
 * widgets to get at the bottom level. That widget will be visited first. Then
 * it will first visit all siblings before going up the the next layer.
 *
 * @todo Write the entire visiting algorithm.
 *
 * The visiting order in our example is:
 * 5, 6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0
 *
 *
 * @section gui2_iterator_iterator Iterator
 *
 * The iterator is the class the users should care about. The user creates the
 * iterator with the selected policy and the root widget. Then the user can
 * visit the widgets.
 *
 * When during the iteration a widget is added to or removed from the
 * widget-tree being walked the iterator becomes invalid. Using the iterator
 * when it is invalid results in Undefined Behavior.
 *
 * When it's certain there's at least one widget to visit a simple do while loop
 * can be used. It the policy visits the widget, it's certain there is at least
 * one widget to visit. Below some sample code:
@code
iterator<policy> itor(root);
assert(!itor.at_end());
do {
	...
	...
} while(itor.next());
@endcode
 *
 * When there might be no widget to visit a simple for loop can be used:
@code
for(iterator<policy> itor(root); !itor.at_end(); ++itor) {
	...
	...
}
@endcode
 *
 *
 * @subsection gui2_iterator_iterator_design Design
 *
 * As seen in the examples above the iterator doesn't look like a iterator in
 * the C++ standard library. The iterator is more designed after the iterator
 * design of the Gang of Four [GoF]. The reason for the different design is that
 * GoF design fits better to the classes as a normal C++ iterator. The rest of
 * this section explains some of the reasons why this design is chosen. The main
 * reason is simple; the iteration of the widgets feels better suited for the
 * GoF-style iteration as the C++-style iteration.
 *
 * The iterator is not lightweight like most C++ iterators, therefore the class
 * in non-copyable. (This is for example also the reason why a std::list has no
 * operator[].) Since operator++(int) should return a copy of the original
 * object it's also omitted.
 *
 * The design makes it hard to back-track the iteration (or costs more memory),
 * so the iterator is forward only. The order policy is added to allow the
 * wanted walking direction, but one-way only.
 *
 * The iterator has a begin, but it's not easy to go back to it and the
 * operation involves rewinding the state, which might be costly. Therefore no
 * begin() function.
 *
 * The end is known at the moment it's reached, but not upfront. That combined
 * with the forward only, makes implementing an end() hard and therefore it is
 * omitted.

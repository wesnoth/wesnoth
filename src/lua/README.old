Current version is 5.1.4 patch 2. This directory contains only the files
from the src/ original directory.

The Lua source is imported in the repository in order to ensure that it
is compiled with the same C++ compiler used for Wesnoth. That way, Lua no
longer relies on setjmp/longjmp and it won't conflict with Wesnoth C++
exceptions.

The original source can be downloaded from http://www.lua.org/ftp/ .
The bugfix patches can be downloaded from http://www.lua.org/bugs.html .

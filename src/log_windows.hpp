/**
 * @file
 * Log file control routines for Windows.
 *
 * During static object initialization, stdout and stderr are redirected to a
 * uniquely-named log file located in the user's temporary directory as defined
 * by the platform (e.g. C:/Users/username/AppData/Local/Temp/wesnoth-XXXX.log).
 * Later, a request may be issued to relocate the log file to a more permanent
 * and user-accessible location (such as the Wesnoth user data directory).
 *
 * Because Wesnoth is normally built with the GUI subsystem option, there is no
 * console on startup and thus no way to see stdout/stderr output. Since
 * version 1.13.1, we can allocate a console during initialization when started
 * with the --wconsole option, but that is a somewhat clunky hack that does not
 * help with post mortem debugging.
 *
 * SDL 1.2 used to redirect stdout and stderr to stdout.txt and stderr.txt in
 * the process working directory automatically, but this approach too had its
 * own shortcomings by assuming the pwd was writable by the process (or in Vista
 * and later versions, requiring UAC virtualization to be enabled).

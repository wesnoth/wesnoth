/**
 * Emulation for C++11's std::map::at().
 *
 * Acts like return map[key], but can be used on const map, and if the key
 * doesn't exist will throw an exception instead of adding the key.
 *
 * A non-official reference can be found here:
 * http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map/at
 *
 * @note Didn't use template<class K, class V> since that has a problem when
 * deducting the type when the key is a std::string and the type send is a
 * character string, e.g. "foo". Letting the map deduct the K and V types works.
 *
 * @throw std::out_of_range       When the key is not in the map.
 *
 * @param map                     The map search into.
 * @param key                     The key to search for.
 *
 * @returns                       A copy of the value of key. @note C++11 uses
 *                                a reference, but it's not possible to create
 *                                a reference from an iterator.

 * reference to a temporary, because they assume that the returned reference may point into the
 * argument. This causes false positives for functions that take a std::map-like object as a
 * separate argument (or as their "this" pointer), where the temporary being passed in is only used
 * as a key to find an object in the map, and the returned reference points to an object owned by
 * the map. Similarly, it's a false positive for data owned by a singleton.
 *
 * GCC-14 supports supressing the warnings with [[gnu::no_dangling]]. Clang complains about unknown
 * attributes in the gnu:: namespace, so has to have the #if, and the #if means we need the #ifdef.

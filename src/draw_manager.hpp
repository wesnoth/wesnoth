/**
 * A global draw management interface.
 *
 * This interface governs drawing things to the screen in the correct order.
 * Drawable objects must inherit from gui2::top_level_drawable, and may be
 * referred to as "TLD"s.
 *
 * There is an absolute requirement that events happen in a certain order.
 * This is mostly managed by this interface, which calls the TLD methods in
 * order at most once every vsync.
 *
 * The order of events is:
 *   1. General event processing. This is governed by events::pump()
 *      and is currently independent of this interface.
 *   2. Layout and animation. TLDs should ensure their layout information
 *      is up-to-date inside gui2::top_level_drawable::layout(). After
 *      this call they should know where they are on the screen, and be
 *      ready to report it via gui2::top_level_drawable::screen_location().
 *      Animation can also be performed during this stage.
 *   3. Offscreen rendering. TLDs should perform any offscreen rendering
 *      during gui2::top_level_drawable::render(). After this call, all
 *      internal drawing buffers should be in a state ready for display.
 *   4. Drawing to the screen. Drawing to the screen should only ever happen
 *      inside gui2::top_level_drawable::expose(). Drawing to the screen at
 *      any other point is an error.
 *
 * The draw manager will call layout(), render() and expose() in the correct
 * order to ensure all TLD objects are laid out correctly and drawn in the
 * correct order.
 *
 * Drawing order of TLDs is initially set by creation time, but a TLD may
 * be raised to the top of the drawing stack by calling
 * draw_manager::raise_drawable() manually. register_drawable() and
 * deregister_drawable() are called automatically by gui2::top_level_drawable
 * in its constructor and destructor, and do not need to be manually managed.
 *
 * The drawing process happens inside draw_manager::sparkle(). In general,
 * a game loop should perform two basic steps.
 *   1. call events::pump() to process events. Anything other than drawing
 *      to the screen may happen during this step.
 *   2. call draw_manager::sparkle() to draw the screen, if necessary.
 *
 * The main sparkle() function will also rate-limit, so callers do not need
 * to add their own delay to their loops. If vsync is disabled, drawing will
 * happen as frequently as possible. If vsync is enabled, this function will
 * wait for the next screen refresh before drawing. In both cases, if nothing
 * needs to be drawn the function will block for an appropriate length of
 * time before returning.
 *
 * To ensure they are presented for drawing, any drawable object must call
 * draw_manager::invalidate_region() to indicate that an area of the screen
 * needs to be redrawn. This may be called during any phase other than the
 * draw phase. Invalidating regions during the draw phase is an error and
 * will throw an exception.

 * Mark a region of the screen as requiring redraw.

 * This should be called any time an item changes in such a way as to
 * require redrawing.
 *
 * This may only be called outside the Draw phase.
 *
 * Regions are combined to result in a minimal number of draw calls,
 * so this may be called for every invalidation without much concern.

 * This includes making sure window sizes and locations are up to date,
 * updating animation frames, and drawing whatever regions of the screen
 * need drawing or redrawing.
 *
 * If vsync is enabled, this function will block until the next vblank.
 * If nothing is drawn, it will still block for an appropriate amount of
 * time to simulate vsync, even if vsync is disabled.

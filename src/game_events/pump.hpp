/**
 * @file
 * Define the game's event mechanism.
 *
 * Events might be units moving or fighting, or when victory or defeat occurs.
 * A scenario's configuration file will define actions to take when certain events occur.
 * This module is responsible for the processing of events.
 *
 * Note that game events have nothing to do with SDL events,
 * like mouse movement, keyboard events, etc.
 * See events.hpp for how they are handled.

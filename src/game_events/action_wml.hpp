 * Define actions for the game's events mechanism.

 * Events might be units moving or fighting, or when victory or defeat occurs.
 * A scenario's configuration file will define actions to take when certain events occur.
 * This module is responsible for implementing some of those actions (i.e. Action WML).
 * The actions not implemented in this module are implemented in Lua.

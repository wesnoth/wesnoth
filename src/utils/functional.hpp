// We'd like to just say "using namespace std::placeholders", but unfortunately
// that clashes with Boost.Bind's placeholders in some cases (even if bind.hpp is not included).
// Instead, we specialize std::is_placeholder for the Boost placeholders,
// so that Boost placeholders can be passed to std::bind.

namespace std { // Some compilers can't handle it being specialized in the global scope
	template<int N>

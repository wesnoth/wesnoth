/**

/**
 * The ranged based for emulation macro.
 *
 * For example iterating over a std:vector<int> named vec turns into:
 * @code
FOREACH(value, vec) {
    ...
}
@endcode
 * This iterates over the copy of a the value, using a reference looks like:
 * @code
FOREACH( & value, vec) {
    ...
}
@endcode
 * Which looks somewhat ugly. To 'fix' the problem the dummy macro @ref AUTO
 * is defined, allowing to use the following syntax:
 * @code
FOREACH(AUTO& value, vec) {
    ...
}
@endcode
 * The @ref AUTO could also have been used in the first example. For
 * readability it might be a good idea to always use the @ref AUTO macro.
 * That way the sytax also looks more like the real C++11 code.

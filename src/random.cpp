/**
 *  @file
 *  Generate random numbers.
 *
 *  There are various ways to get a random number.
 *  rand()              This can be used for things that never are send over the
 *                      network e.g. generate a random map (the final result the
 *                      map is send, but the other players don't need to generate
 *                      the map.
 *
 *  get_random()        A random generator which is synchronized over the network
 *                      this only seems to work when it's used by 1 player at the
 *                      same time. It's synchronized after an event so if an event
 *                      runs at two clients at the same time it gets out of sync
 *                      and sets the entire game out of sync.
 *
 *  game_state::get_random()
 *                      A random generator which is seeded by the host of an MP
 *                      game. This generator is (not yet) synchronized over the
 *                      network. It's only used by [set_variable]rand=. The map
 *                      designer has to make sure it stays in sync. This
 *                      generator can be used at the same time at multiple client
 *                      since the generators are always in sync.

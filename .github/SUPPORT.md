## Getting in Touch

If you have any questions or just want to hang out, the best place to find us is on our [official Discord community server](https://discord.gg/battleforwesnoth). There you can find the dev team as well as many other fellow Wesnoth players and modders.

The Discord server is mirrored to freenode IRC, channels: [`#wesnoth`](https://webchat.freenode.net/#wesnoth) (general discussions), [`#wesnoth-umc-dev`](https://webchat.freenode.net/#wesnoth-umc-dev) (questions about creating add-ons), [`#wesnoth-dev`](https://webchat.freenode.net/#wesnoth-dev)  (development of wesnoth mainline).

You can also leave a question on the [Wesnoth forums](https://forums.wesnoth.org/).

Submitting Issues
=================

Please follow the guidelines [here](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/ReportingBugs) when submitting bug reports or feature requests.

When submitting an issue that involves a long log, we recommend using gist and linking to it, as that allows it to be viewed without downloading. If the issue involves a screenshot or save file, please attach the screenshot or savefile by dragging it into the issue submission textbox.

If you have push access, please remember when creating issues to add the bug or enhancement label as well as at least one applicable purple label.

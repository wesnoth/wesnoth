Note: The house style of Wesnoth uses a good many words and constructions that
are archaic, poetic, or dialectal. If you speak modern English as a second
language you may incorrectly read these as errors. Please see
[NotSpellingMistakes](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/NotSpellingMistakes) for a list
of things you will encounter that may look like spelling or usage errors but
are not.

Note that the mainline campaigns are now using correct typography,
including sexed quotes and en and em dashes. These will appear as three byte
sequences if you are not using a viewer that supports UTF-8.

* Please quote the text verbatim. You can use `**bold**` to point out the mistaken part:

* _(optional)_ What do you propose to change the text to?

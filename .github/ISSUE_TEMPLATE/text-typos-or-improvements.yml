        **Note:** The house style of Wesnoth uses a good many words and constructions that are archaic, poetic,
        or dialectal. If you speak modern English as a second language you may incorrectly read these as errors.
        Please see [NotSpellingMistakes](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/NotSpellingMistakes) for a list of things you
        will encounter that may look like spelling or usage errors but are not.

        Note that the mainline campaigns are now using correct typography, including sexed quotes and en and em
        dashes. These will appear as three byte sequences if you are not using a viewer that supports UTF-8.

### UI
   * The footprint path system now gives immidiate strong feedback when multiturn movement is assigned.
     * It does this by flashing any such footprints and fades them out over 2 seconds even as the unit is deselected.
   * Changed how the red tint that indicated how movement costs works behind the scene. (cleanup)

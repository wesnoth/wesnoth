   * Multihex option for image overlays added
		* Larger images placed with [item] in WML or wesnoth.interface.add_hex_overlay() in Lua can now be multihex by adding "multihex = true" or "multihex = yes".
		* For removal of a multihex image: simply remove the center piece of it the same way as usual.

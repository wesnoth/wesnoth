### WML Engine
   * Because priority= allows to change order of calculations without exclude some of them(we have ever cth = base_cth + add1 + add2) a [suppress_lower_priority] subtag will be added to abilities and specials who don't return boolean values, which can not only erase lower-priority abilities corresponding to the filter, much like overwrite_specials=[overwrite], but unlike the latter, it's not limited to special weapons, but also applies to abilities like `[heals], [regenerate], or [leadership], among others..
     * Add to [suppress_lower_priority] an affect_side attribute to suppress special abilities affecting a unit applied to a particular side (apply_to=self or opponent) and which discriminates special abilities that affect self/student from special abilities belonging to the opponent, even if apply_to=attacker/defender is used (for specials only).

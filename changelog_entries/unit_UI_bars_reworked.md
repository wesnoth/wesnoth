### UI
  * Reworked how the health bar, xp bar, movement orb and leadership crown will appear with units ingame.
    * The UI now scales more as you zoom. (Making it bigger when zoomed out and smaller when zoomed in relative to the unit)
    * The UI is wider and uses stronger border contrasts to make it more readable. Also fades the left/right borders.
    * The health bar of full hp units have a more muted green, to more easily see what units are damaged.
    * The UI now fully highlights as you hover or select the unit.
    * A divider line between the filled and unfilled area of the bar has been added to improve clarity.

### Units
  * Elvish Sylph:
     * The Elvish Sylph, Shyde, and Enchantress received massive buffs in 1.18. Those have been partially walked back in #8749, but these units still remain outliers in power at their respective levels - especially now that most undead have -40% arcane resist.
     * A dexterous Sylph, for example, is better than a Great Mage in almost every possible aspect - damage, movement, hitpoints, melee, support (slows), and defense.
     * This change brings most of their stats back down to their 1.16 levels (or slightly stronger), but deliberately leaves the Sylph and Enchantress's slowing attacks unnerfed; I think those attacks are somewhat weak in comparison to their much more deadly arcane attacks.
     * cost 135 -> 110, hitpoints 68 -> 60, faerie fire 13-5 -> 10-5 (ranged arcane).
  * Elvish Enchantress:
     * Same reasoning as the Sylph changes, but much smaller in magnitude.
     * cost 62 -> 57, faerie fire 11-4 -> 10-4 (ranged arcane).
  * Elvish Shyde:
     * Same reasoning as the Sylph changes. As a flying, slowing, magical healer with 6mp, the Shyde was powerful even before the numerous buffs she received in 1.18. This is a reversion to her 1.16 values.
     * cost 58 -> 52, hitpoints 51 -> 46, entangle 7-3 -> 6-3 (ranged impact), thorns 10-3 -> 8-3 (ranged pierce), faerie touch 7-2 -> 6-2 (melee impact).

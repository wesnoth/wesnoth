### Units
  * Elvish Sylph:
     * Now that most undead have had their arcane vulnerabilities increased to 40%, the Sylph's 1.18 buffs make her ludicrously strong against them. These changes bring most of her stats back down to 1.16, while leaving her slowing attacks unchanged.
     * cost 135 -> 110, hitpoints 68 -> 60, faerie fire (ranged arcane) 13-5 -> 10-5.
  * Elvish Enchantress:
     * Same reasoning as the Sylph changes, but much smaller in magnitude.
     * cost 62 -> 59, faerie fire (ranged arcane) 11-4 -> 10-4.
  * Elvish Shyde:
     * As a flying, slowing, magical healer with 6mp, the Shyde was powerful even before the numerous buffs she received in 1.18. This is a reversion to her 1.16 values.
     * cost 58 -> 52, hitpoints 51 -> 46, entangle (ranged impact) 7-3 -> 6-3, thorns (ranged pierce) 10-3 -> 7-3, faerie touch (melee impact) 7-2 -> 6-2.

 ### Miscellaneous and Bug Fixes
   * Removed the config-dir, userconfig-dir, config-path, and userconfig-path commandline options
   * Moved the editor, WML persist, saves, lua command history, and most of the preferences to a separate subfolder for all data that should be synced between multiple computers

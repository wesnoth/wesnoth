Contributing
------------

Wesnoth is most in need of skilled C++ developers (C++14 and later), however there are things that nearly anyone can help with from simpler tasks in C++, the Lua and WML used for content scripting, Python used by various external tools, and even things like play testing and giving feedback on updated campaigns. Additionally, Wesnoth lacks art for a variety of unit animations - anyone who would be interested in lending a hand updating existing unit sprites or creating animations should take a look at the Art Forum as well as contact our current art director.

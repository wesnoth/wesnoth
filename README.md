Contributing
------------

Wesnoth is most in need of skilled C++ developers (C++14 and later), however there are things that nearly anyone can help with:
* Simple tasks in C++.
* The Lua and WML used for content scripting.
* Python used by various external tools.
* Even play testing and giving feedback on updated campaigns!

Additionally, Wesnoth lacks art for a variety of unit animations - anyone who would be interested in lending a hand in updating existing unit sprites or creating animations should take a look at the [Art Contributions](https://forums.wesnoth.org/viewforum.php?f=9) forum as well as contact our current art director.

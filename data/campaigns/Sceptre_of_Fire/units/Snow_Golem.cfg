    description= _ "Snow Golems are loosely humanoid forms that wander the frozen north, without any apparent role in nature, being neither predator nor prey. Many say they are forgotten constructs of forgotten battles, due to their relation to the weaker Snow Imps. Others say the far north is a hostile land, and these monsters are simply a manifestation of that danger." + "

" + _ "As they are constructs of snow and ice, they can repair and regenerate when in a favorable environment. However, the icy regrowth seems prone to errors, so while they were likely formed in the image of ideal warriors, they have become misshapen and their movement thus compromised. This malformation is most obvious in their hand and arms, which take the most damage."

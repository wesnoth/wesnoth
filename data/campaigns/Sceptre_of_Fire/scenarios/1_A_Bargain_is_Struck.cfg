        # The conversation Haldric alludes to took place in the Legend of
        # Wesmere scenario "The Treaty", which is thus pinned to 15YW.

        # Xenophobic faction at start of this campaign, e.g 25YW.  This
        # development is noted as having begun on the main timeline in 24YW.
        # Be careful to change this chronology consistently, if you do so.

A description of this addon's code:

This addon makes a lot use of lua wherever possible, even [side] definitions
were moved to lua by using scenario_generation=lua, that is why the [multiplayer]
tags are nearly empty. One of the main advantage of this is that this addon
doesn't increase the wesnoth parsing time, also i just found lua easier to
read and much easier to debug since it gives better error messages, and doesnâ€™t
require reloading the cache after changes were made.

The directory is organized as follows:

./lua/map :
the files in ./lua/map contain the code that generate the content of the
[multiplayer] tag, in particular [side] definitions, [event]s, map_data and
[load_resource]. The biggest part of the scenario is the map generation,
World conquest map generation works as follows: First we run the wesnoth 
default map generator (here: the files in lua/map/generator), then we run
a custom lua scrips to fix it up (lua/map/postgeneration). For each
scenario there ia a fixed set of generator+postgenerator pairs defined in
lua/map/scenarios for each scenario.

./lua/shared_utils :
libraries and helper functions that are used by both the map editor and
during the actual game.

./lua/optional_mechanics :
A few lua mechanics that works independent on the rest of the world conquest
II code.

./lua/era :
the code for the World Conquest era, this is in particular the recruitment in pair
function. And delivering wc data that depends on the current era (for
example which heroes should be available for which faction)

./lua/game_mechanics :
The lua code that implements the custom game mechanics of World Conquest, that is:
The dropping system, the invest system, the training system, World Conquest
specific abilities, the bonus points system

./lua/campaign :
The code specific to the wc2 campaign: the difficulties, victory conditions,
enemy spawns etc.

./resources :
The training and artifact definitions

./era :
The factions of the World Conquest era.

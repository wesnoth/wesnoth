* translatable strings are still a mess, some are defined at top of the file while other are defined in the middle.

* the artifacts file should be change in the same way as the training file wrt translatable strings.

* We should consider moving the pickup event implementation to core (and rename it)

* Maybe change the recruit costs for certain types of units. e.g. Fencers are too expensive, Dwarvish fighters are too cheap etc.

* Maybe readd the ruined Fence terrain but in better quality.

            story= _ "After a few weeks of putting down minor rebellions and clearing out the last human strongholds, the first snows of the long northern winter began to fall. A few days after the first snowfall a goblin rider — half dead from exhaustion — raced into Dorset with the news that Borstep was under siege by a large force of dwarves, outlaws and elves."

        [part]
            story= _ "The orcish commanders were stunned. How had such a large enemy force penetrated so deep and so far into orcish territory, especially without their knowledge? How also had their enemies known to strike at Borstep, which was the rally point for orcish forces as well as their main arms and supply depot?"

        [part]
            story= _ "Kapou’e suspected some sort of treachery. Under the assumption that human attacks would be minimal due to the harsh weather, he left only a small force to defend Dorset while he and the main horde of orcs sped to the aid of Borstep."

        [part]
            story= _ "Rushing to reach Borstep before the river froze up for the winter, the orcs sailed up the River Bork. Paddling day and night the horde barely managed to get through the Silent Forest before the river froze solid. Beaching their crafts, they marched the last leg of their journey through the deepening snow of the Mourned Hills."

        [part]
            story= _ "As they crested the last hill before the city, the sight before them cast them into gloom; there was nothing left of Borstep. The walls had been smashed, houses burnt and its inhabitants driven out or slaughtered. Of the orcish shamans there was no sign."

        [part]
            story= _ "With eyes burning with apprehension and rage, Kapou’e sent his riders out to scour the land in all directions for the culprits while he made camp with the rest of the horde. A few hours later a rider reported back that he had picked up a trail of a large body of dwarves, elves and humans heading east through the mountains."

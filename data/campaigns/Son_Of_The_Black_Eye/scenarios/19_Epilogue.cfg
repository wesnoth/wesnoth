            story= _ "True to his word, once Lanbec’h had been slain, Howgarth III dispersed the Earl’s forces and withdrew them from orcish territory. For his part Kapou’e withdrew from Dorest and dispersed the Great Horde. However, before the horde was dispersed he appointed three more shamans — with the consent of all — to make the Great Council complete again."

            story= _ "Kapou’e ruled for many years, and those years were a time of unprecedented prosperity and unity for the orcs. Under the leadership of Kapou’e, the united orc forces thoroughly scoured their territory of any renegade bands of humans, dwarves, elves, and undead. Agreements were thrashed out to the effect that orcs desiring to trade would have free passage anywhere in orcish territory without hindrance from other tribes."

            story= _ "During the eighth year of Kapou’e’s reign, and then again in the fourteenth, the orcish territories were once again invaded, first by the elves, and then once again by the humans. As testament to the power of the orcs united under Kapou’e, both attacks were quickly and decisively crushed, even before the Northern Alliance could intervene."

            story= _ "In order to keep fighting between the tribes to a minimum, Kapou’e also maintained an enormous army, drawn from all corners of his empire. To offset the cost of maintaining such an army, he often hired out portions of it to act as mercenaries in foreign struggles. People of all races took advantage of this and, consequently, those orcs thirsting for battle got more than enough to keep them from attacking their nearest neighbors."

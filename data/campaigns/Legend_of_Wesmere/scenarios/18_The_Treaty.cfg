And if you are authorized to make such decisions, then I intend to renew our alliance by signing a new treaty right here on the battlefield."

        # Historical note:
        # In Sceptre Of Fire, the beginning of which is dated 25YW, it is said
        # that this conversation took place five years ago. So this has to
        # be 20YW. Beware of changing the chronology of this scenario without
        # tweaking SoF as well.

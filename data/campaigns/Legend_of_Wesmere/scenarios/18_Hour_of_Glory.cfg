Kalenz, your mission is complete. The orcish Great Chieftain is dead and you have recaptured your home. Yet I sense there is turmoil in your mind..."

It is indeed as you say, Cleodil. It is that potion that gnaws at me. I cannot enjoy our victories, nor can I rest. I am fighting it every single moment."

You will not die. You must fight it. I have faith in you Kalenz...beloved...you will overcome and master it. It will be hard and painful, but you will beat the potion. It is Landar that truly concerns me..."

Some dwarves have been found dead in our camp. Landar is extremely unfriendly towards them, and ill-feeling is growing. I think the dwarves will leave us soon."

There are a lot of things my father did that I can not understand; he grew suspicious and strange in his last days. But <i>I</i> am the King of Wesnoth now, not my father! And it is my intention to renew our alliance by signing a new treaty here, with you."

        # Historical note:
        # In Sceptre Of Fire, the beginning of which is dated 25YW, it is said
        # that this conversation took place ten years ago.  So this has to
        # be 15YW.  Beware of changing the chronology of this scenario without
        # tweaking SoF as well.

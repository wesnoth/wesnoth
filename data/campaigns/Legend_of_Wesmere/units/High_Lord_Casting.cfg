    description= _ "While the duality of Elven magic manifests itself most strongly in the split paths between the corporeal and arcane worlds, the same dichotomy is reflected in the ranks of Elven nobility. In part due to their use of faerie fire, most lords find themselves strongly aligned with enchantresses, thus associating themselves with the aspects of insight and destruction. Though not the same thing as wisdom, a lord’s intuition is usually to be respected, and his wrath, feared. This only grows more true with age, as time brings acuity to the elf’s mind and senses.

Outsiders’ notions that an upper class of ‘High Lords’ exists is usually a fallacy resulting from the great disparity in both perception and power that these experienced elves possess. In actuality, the hierarchy of Elvish rule differs between enclaves and situationally between times of peace and war. The only thing that can be said for certain is that the acumen of these lords is invaluable for maintaining the prosperity of Elvish rule, whether or not they sit at the top of the chain of command."

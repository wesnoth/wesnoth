    description= _"Humans of the Green Isle met Wesfolk as a people of crude bridands, but this wasn't always the case. The Ancient Wesfolk inhabited vast territories of the Old Continent. They had their priests, their cities, their kingdoms.
        
Sorcerers of Wesfolk always gravitated towards the art of shadows and darkness. Legends say that misfortunes and decay befell Wesfolk exactly after their dark mages had discovered the secret of everlasting life. Lich Lords were powerful but lacked any respect for a human life. They used their human subjects as mere tools, waged bloody wars and conducted dark studies.

Necromancy worsened relations with neighbours. After a series of catastrophic conflicts combined with endless internal strife, most of their kin had to flee to the Green Isle. Summoning of the orcs became the final and ultimate sign of their fall: the fear of defeat and imminent end of their unlife made the Lich-Lords betray their own people.

That's how the once great Wesfolk people turned into gangs of miserable outlaws."

    description=_ "In ancient times, every baron had a charioteer, a loyal companion who drove his chariot. The charioteer fought shoulder to shoulder with the patron, sat next to him at feasts, was among the first to take meat and drink from the cup.

Now a rare baron can afford a chariot, but the status of the charioteer as a loyal companion has been preserved. Only personal ties bind the charioteer to the baron, but they are stronger than any contract, and often only death breaks them. Even without a chariot, the charioteer is a dangerous opponent, hardly inferior to his patron in close or long-range combat."

The Lich-Lords, keenly aware of their disdain, respond in kind, periodically decreeing their persecution. Even the mortal Wesfolk view them with little favour, though they lack the will to pursue them, content to let the Wandering Warriors dwell in solitude amidst the shadowed woods and perilous marshes."

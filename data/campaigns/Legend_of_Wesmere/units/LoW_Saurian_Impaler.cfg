    description= _ "Not all saurians rely solely on agility. Some, learning the harsh lessons of battle against heavily armored foes, choose to exchange their mobility for sheer penetrating power. The Saurian Impalers wield long, heavy spears designed not for throwing, but for a single, devastating purpose: to impale the enemy and hold the line. Their powerful legs and compact stance allow them to brace their weapons with shocking stability, creating a wall of lethal points that can stop a cavalry charge dead in its tracks."

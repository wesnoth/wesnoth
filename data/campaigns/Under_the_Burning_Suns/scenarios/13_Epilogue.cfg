The fetid darkness had lifted from the land and I saw the suns shining brightly for what seemed like the first time in ages. Gazing across the bright green trees and sparkling ocean I realized that once this had been a place of beauty. Several of our brethren were waiting for me and I was overjoyed to discover that they were no longer the mindless slaves I had seen before. They too had broken free from their enchantment."

Luckily we had already destroyed most of the island’s foul inhabitants, and lacking their former discipline we had no trouble exterminating the remaining orcs and undead. The naga too fled before us, and they have not bothered us since. For once we seemed to be safe from imminent danger."

We made a pact between elf and merfolk and vowed to live together in peace and prosperity. Melusand blessed the island, and named it ‘Quenoth Isle’ in honor of our people. The merfolk have been very helpful in teaching us how to adapt to this strange land, though I still have trouble getting used to being surrounded by water. It used to be more precious than gold. Still, I could hardly imagine a better home for my people. Between the bounty of the sea and the many fruits of the jungle there is no shortage of food. We are isolated from the chaos on the mainland and the merfolk guard the waters. Melusand says now is a time for peace and prosperity. Part of me didn’t think we would survive our journey, there were so many close calls. Coming here almost does seem like a miracle. If only I could forget the price we paid..."

No one has been more enthusiastic than she in embracing our life among the islands. She delights in swimming and sailing among the shallows and spends so much time in the water that sometimes I think she is half mermaid herself. Her sparkling laugh and quick wit are a daily gift to us. She entertains the children with thrilling (though often slightly embellished) tales of our great journey, and at times when I get moody, she reminds me what a joy it is to be alive in this great land. She is a living testament to the fact that even though we were born among the sands we can thrive anywhere we have the will to live."

Despite the hardships of our journey and Yechnagoth’s deceptions, our victory has only strengthened her faith. She will be as quick as always to correct the error of your ways if you ever express a disbelief in the powers of Eloh. She told me recently that all the trials and triumphs of our journey were but parts of Eloh’s great plan for us, and this new home is our reward. She is spending her time now teaching a whole new generation of priestesses and telling all the old stories to the children so that they won’t be forgotten. She has started designing a sacred grove in the jungle for Eloh, as our people did in the olden times. I am still not quite used to seeing so many trees, but perhaps, as some people say, it is a sign that the peace and prosperity of old has come again."

We filled the entire structure with wood and oil and set the place ablaze to make sure that any remnants of Yechnagoth’s infestation would be purged by holy fire. We then tore the citadel down, stone by stone. I was tempted to save the stones for construction in the future, but I did not know what foul magics might still linger in them, and I did not want to take any chances. So with the help of the merfolk, we carried the stones far out into the water and cast them down to the bottom of the ocean. Once the last stone had been removed, we decided that no matter what we built or grew around it, that area would be left bare as a reminder of the evil that once dwelt here and all those who gave their lives to destroy it."

Looking at the ruins of the ancient empires, I know that time erases all things. We have forgotten so much about the Golden Age. Do not let our story suffer the same fate. For as long as the tales of those now departed are still told, in some sense they are still alive and still with us. Honor those who have died. Remember our mistakes so you will not repeat them.

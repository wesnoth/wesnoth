I still remember her exact words: <i>“You must be strong, young elf, for you enter a time of peril. The home you know will be destroyed, and you must lead your people to a new land. To the north you will find salvation and peace. Cross the desert and head to the mountains. Fear not, for I will guide you and protect you.”</i> I’m not sure why I’m the one she chose to appeal to, but if this is her will, I will see it done. Our home is gone and the desert is a harsh place. If Eloh has prepared a new home for us, then I will lead us there."

But the fire was big enough to burn the bodies to ashes and speed their souls to the hereafter. I remember at the time that the death of so many of our people was not the best omen for the start of such a large journey. They were the first of our people to die in this great endeavor, but they were to be far from the last."

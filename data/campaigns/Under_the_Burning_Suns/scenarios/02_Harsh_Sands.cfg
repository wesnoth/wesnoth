            story= _ "Chapter 2: When I was fifteen I went on my first raid, against an orcish incursion to the west. A large band of orcs under some new banner had come out of the northern foothills and were rampaging across the sands, killing anything they could get their filthy hands on."
        [/part]

        [part]
            story= _ "Sneaking amidst the dunes we crept up to their camp and ambushed them at dawn. To a young boy the fighting was overwhelming: crashing blades, blood, battle cries, friend and foe struggling back and forth. The orcs rallied around their leader, their greater numbers countering our superior skill at combat. It was my father who finally fought his way to the foul orc leader and slew him on the ochre sand, stained with blood. The surviving orcs, showing their true colors, fled from the battlefield. It seemed a glorious victory, and I hardly noticed our elven brethren lying dead in the sand."
        [/part]

        [part]
            story= _ "I was giddy on the journey back home, my heart pumping with elation and pride. I had fought my first battle; now I was a man like my father. Then one night during the long dark a harsh wind came up, moaning and howling around our tents. By dawn it had only gotten worse; I wondered if some dark god was trying to avenge the massacre of the orcs. I'd seen sandstorms before, but I had never experienced one like this. I hid in my tent praying to Eloh as if my life depended on it. The air grew thick with sand, and everything grew dark and hazy..."
        [/part]

        [part]
            story= _ "The next thing I remember, someone was bending over me shaking me awake. I was half buried in sand, and I felt weak but alive. Our equipment was scattered across the dunes or buried in the sand. Looking around I only saw a few of my companions, who were digging in the sand, fervently hoping to find other survivors. I dug furiously at the sand with my bare hands and yelled until I was hoarse, but try as I might, I could not find my father. They told me he had been swallowed by the sand, but I would not be consoled. In one instant my world crumbled; I never looked at the sands quite the same way again. I learned that day that the desert can be fickle and fierce, and death is always lurking just over the horizon."
        [/part]

        [part]
            story= _ "Now I journeyed out again across the sands, but this time it was not just myself, but my entire people that I had to protect. They were depending on my judgment, and I was only too aware of the weight on my narrow shoulders. Thinking of the last time we had gone out in force, I made a silent prayer to my father to watch over us. There was nowhere to go but north."

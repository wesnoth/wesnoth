# Scenario should work under following assumptions:
# -- Player finds himself on the battlefield between feuding undead.
# -- Undead deploy champions (one each).
# -- Number of tents saved from destruction affects unit cost later in campaign
# -- Character Garak is removed from campaign at this stage.
# -- There is an orc raid in second half.
# -- There is no timeflow, scenario takes place at night.

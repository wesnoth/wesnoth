They really know how to work fire and use it in amazing ways. They have some interesting ideas about how they might improve their smithing with my magical fire. And have you seen their records? They have kept records of their dealings that go back generations upon generations. They even know of the dwarven clan who helped craft the sceptre of fire. Imagine if I could find the dwarves who helped build such an artifact!"

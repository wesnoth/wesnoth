Seeing Grendel with us, a troop of dwarves silently appeared out of adjoining secret passages. Once we had assured the rest of the elves that they were friends, Grendel led us silently and quickly through a maze of secret tunnels towards the Dwarves' home."

            story= _ "I do not know how long we tramped through those tiny dark passages; time seemed to flow differently down there, deep under the earth. But when we finally got to our destination, what I saw was breathtaking. We entered into a large cavern, where the dwarves had built a huge city out of stone. Protected by stone walls and gates that were bigger than I had ever seen, the place seemed virtually impregnable. As we entered I marveled at their stonework and I saw that the place was crawling with dwarves. It was bigger than any village I had ever seen."

        [part]
            story= _ "The dwarves led us through to the far side of the city, where they let us stay in several auxiliary caverns, which normally served as store rooms. The accommodations were a bit cramped, but for the first time since I had plunged into the earth, I felt safe."

        [part]
            story= _ "The dwarf king was away cleaning up after the recent battle, and would not be back for several days. I happily spent what little time I had learning as much as I could about these strange people. I was very impressed by their craftmanship; they made weapons and armor of a quality I had never seen before. We were also quite the curiosity to the dwarves; I have no idea when they last saw an elf. While some seemed suspicious or frightened of us, the dwarves overall were very polite and met our every need. Finally the summons came to meet with the dwarven king..."

# Scenario 3: A Stirring in the Night (alternate)

#!-- This would be a side branch to try new things while keeping camapign intact and playable
#!-- As trying to rewrite everything from the start would inadvertly screw something big I'll try it this way

#!-- Because of the sheer size of the task ahead I'll take modular approach
#!-- Main scenario file will only call macros and set the enviroment
#!-- Every macro will be defined in it's own file in /utils/scen3_alt
#!-- This should allow minimalise effort needed when tweaking/fixing/removing/replacing events
#!-- I am aware that tasks requiring mechanical alteration of whole scenario file will be made harder in this way
#!-- But I think this can be overcome by proper shell scripting
#!-- If you are a new maintainer and feel this deployment is limiting feel free to abandon it

#!-- Scenario notes
#!-- Scenario should work under following assumptions
#!-- Player finds himself on the battlefield between feuding undead
#!-- Undead deploy champions (one each)
#!-- Number of tents saved from destruction affects unit limit later in campaign
#!-- Character Garak is removed from campaign at this stage
#!-- There is an orc raid in second half 
#!-- Thereis no timeflow, scenario takes place at night
#!-- Above gives us

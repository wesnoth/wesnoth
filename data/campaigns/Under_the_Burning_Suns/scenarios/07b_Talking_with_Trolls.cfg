Once we had assured the rest of the elves that the trolls were our allies, Zurg led us silently and quickly away from the front lines through a maze of secret tunnels."

        [part]
            story= _ "I do not know how long we tramped through those tiny dark passages; time seemed to flow differently down there, deep under the earth. But finally we stepped out into a large cavern. Dominating the cavern were the remains of what must have originally been a dwarf city. The large stone walls were riddled with giant holes and the iron gates had been blasted asunder. As we entered through the gates, we saw dead dwarves and other more grisly signs of recent battle. All around us were many trolls, working hard to repair the walls and other defenses. Zurg led us through the chaos to several side caverns which had until recently been used as storerooms. There was plenty of space for us to bed down and stay out of the way, and the dwarves had left behind plenty of provisions. "

        [part]
            story= _ "Zurg told us that they had just captured this city from the dwarves, and that the Great Leader had moved here to set up his base of operations. They were clearly worried about a dwarf counterattack. Luckily the trolls were quite skilled at stonework and the walls were quickly repaired. The trolls didn't talk much, but were very intelligent and clearly weren't the bloodthirsty savages they were purported to be. Overall they actually seemed quite peaceful, except when provoked. I learned that the leadership was balanced between the warriors and the shamans. The troll's military leader was chosen and advised by a council of their shamans."

            story= _ "I wish I could have spent more time learning about these misunderstood creatures, but we could not tarry long. Even protected by the trolls, caught in the middle of this great war, I feared for the safety of my people. And so after waiting a few days, I was able to get an audience with the Great Leader."

What remains is a large stone throne, which has been covered with skulls and animal skins and bright paint. The walls were once covered with frescoes and dwarven runes, but several trolls are busy chipping them off. The floor was once tiled in dark slate, but only two small patches of tiles remain around the two chairs in this chamber. You're surprised to see that small tile path running up the center of the chamber has been left untouched. It leads to a small stone chair facing the large throne."

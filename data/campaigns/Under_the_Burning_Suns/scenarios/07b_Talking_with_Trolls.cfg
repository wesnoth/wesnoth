What remains is a large stone throne, which has been covered with skulls and animal skins and bright paint. The walls were once covered with frescoes and dwarven runes, but several trolls are busy chipping them off. The floor was once tiled in dark slate, but only two small patches of tiles remain around the two chairs in this chamber. You’re surprised to see that small tile path running up the center of the chamber has been left untouched. It leads to a small stone chair facing the large throne."

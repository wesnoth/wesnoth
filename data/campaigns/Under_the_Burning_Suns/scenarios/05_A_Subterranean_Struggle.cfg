We had brought along palm torches, and we had scavenged other torches from the orcs, so we had enough light sources, at least for the moment. Even so, the guttering torches shed little light, and shadows flickered everywhere. The walls were damp and clammy, the air seemed stale and the sound of our footsteps echoed up and down the passageway."

            story= _ "This seemed about as alien an environment as we could ever be in. We were people of the open sands, and even during the long dark we could look up and orient ourselves by the stars glittering brightly in their heights. I knew logically that we could not go over those frozen mountains, and we could not go back, but I shivered at the thought of miles and miles of rock above me, and felt the weight of the mountain closing around me. The passage twisted and turned, and soon I lost all sense of direction, but since there were no side-passages, we had little choice but to keep going forward."

            story= _ "Looking back, I think the bravest thing that my people ever did was to follow me into the darkness solely on the promises of Eloh and their faith in my leadership. I had no idea how long we would be trapped underground, or even which way we should go. I just hoped Eloh would guide us somehow. Nym said that people whispered that I could lead them through anything, and it was true that when we left I had hardly imagined that we would fight outlaws, undead, orcs and goblins. My previous life seemed like years ago, even though it had only been ten days since our village was demolished."

            story= _ "What lurked in the darkness? Who were the unbelievers that Eloh so cryptically referred to? My heart beat loudly in my chest, everything seemed amplified down here. I had the strong suspicion that this was not a place that my people were meant to be. I strode onwards grimly; considering everything we had gone through so far, Uria be damned if I was going to be frightened now."

<Once someone moves to the end of the small tunnel, an entrance will be blown open; troll guards notice this; dialogue>

<By going into the eastern chamber, the group sees trolls interrogating a dwarf; they kill him after he refuses to talk>

<After going into the narrow tunnel, the group finds a Dwarvish Stalwart, Rogrimir, being attacked by Ulg the Troll Whelp; after saving him, he joins the group; dialogue>

<Upon going south, the group finds a huge room with lava that slows our heroes and deals a lot of damage to those who go in it; Troll Shaman-spawned fire elementals dwell in it; shamans destroy the bridge and
    gradually create more elementals; dialogue>

<In the southeastern part of the lava chamber, there is a tunnel that leads to a spring that allows a unit to heal by 10 HP per turn>

<In the western part of the lava chamber, there is a tunnel where the explorer finds a dwarf's ghost; he asks that his bones be buried>

<Once the bones (in the northwestern part of the lava chamber) are buried, the dwarfish ghost allows the player to pass; dialogue>

<When one captures the village in the troll crypt that the dwarfish ghost was previously blocking, a Troll Soulless is spawned; dialogue>

<Over the chasm, there is a sarcophagus that has a troll corpse in it along with a wand that grants the user with poisoning melee>
    - Possibility: make the item accessible and suitable for more than just Desert Shydes/Stars

<When a side one unit reaches the other side, one of the shamans summons more fire elementals while the other goes to get reinforcements>

<Eventually, the group works its way into the troll lair at the end of the tunnel; the tunnel's entrance exists near the south side of the lava chamber; lots of trolls spawn; dialogue>

<Once three elves work their way into the chamber, the shaman shall summon troll WCs; dialogue>

<Eventually, they slay the chieftain; victory; dialogue>

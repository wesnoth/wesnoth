- Choosing the trolls as allies is too hard.

- The whole campaign seems to be unbalanced by being too easy in general.

- The unit graphics of the desert elves are very outdated. They are
  based on the mainline elves found in Wesnoth 1.0 and lack the team
  colourisation. They look strange compared to the enemies that have
  current mainline quality. An attempt to produce new graphics has
  started there:

  But the thread did not show any progress for a while now.

  Disposition: While this should be fixed, I don't think it's a release
  blocker.  Considering the story context, the odd appearance of the 
  Quenoth elves is almost an asset. I encourage Jetrel to finish the
  TC pass on them he was planning.

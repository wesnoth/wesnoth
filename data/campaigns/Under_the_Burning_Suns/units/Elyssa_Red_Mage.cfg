	unit_description= _ "Upon the successful termination of their apprenticeship, a mage is stripped of the blue robes of an apprentice, and given the red robes of a master. The significance of this change is often lost on the peasantry, who mistakenly title Master Magi as 'Red Magi'. Likewise, the symbolism of the change in colors is often mistaken to signify the mage's ability to seemingly conjure fire from nothing but thin air, a trick which, although undeniably useful, is viewed as a crass application of the knowledge which they have painstakingly accrued.

Though physically frail, and untrained as warriors, the 'Red Magi' have a number of tricks up their sleeves, including the gouts of fire which may have cemented their colloquial name.

Special Notes: the red mage's fireballs are magical, and always have a high chance of hitting an opponent."

Like Shydes, they are capable of gliding unencumbered across almost any terrain except deep water. The hex they occupy and all adjacent hexes are illuminated so that the never experience night. As a result, when a unit is adjacent to a Desert Star, it will fight as if it were day when it is dusk, and as if it were dusk when it is night. Eloh's power also reduces the wounds that Desert Stars suffer when attacked. "

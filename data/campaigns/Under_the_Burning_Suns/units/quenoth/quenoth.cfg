    description= _ "The desert elves that call themselves the 'Quenoth' are the descendants of the woodland elves, one of a handfull of factions that
survived the cataclysm, counting never much on numbers. They inhabit the 'Great Southern Desert' some tribes settled around oases, some following a nomadic
lifestyle. With the downfall of the green woods they adapted to the climate and rhytmen of the dual suns, Sela and Naia.

Their skin and hair has darkened compared to those of their ancestors,
The eyes have adapted the reflections that can be found in the ones of cats,
and like them they are specialised on the twillight hours of the day.

During the times since the climatic changes they have developed a greater robustness against extreme hotness and coldness.

Circadian Rhythm:

* Nomadic living tribes:
* First dawn - The scouts start pathfinding, the rest of the tribe takes care of the deers.
- The desert is a moving target. Dunes wander, Oases dry out and new ones appear in other regions.
* First morning -
* First Midday -

* Resting tribes:

* Settled tribes:


Weapons:

Bows don't stand long against the great temperature differences that comes with the day/night cycles,
they have been replaced by bolas as the common distance weapon.

The melee units rely on curved blades with long handles, both usuable as spears and blades.

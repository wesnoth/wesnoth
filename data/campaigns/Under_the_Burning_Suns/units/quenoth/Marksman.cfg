    description= _ "In times past, the elvesâ€™ supremacy at archery was unquestioned among the other races of the Great Continent. With archery being less viable in a land of scarce cover, however, the skills of the few remaining elven bowmen became suspect, to the point that even their brethren began to believe that archery was more of an outdated relic than a practical tool for battle.

A simple glance at a Quenoth Marksman in action would be enough to dispel this foolish train of thought. Capable of the same legendary feats as their ancestors, these master archers can achieve the same speed and precision as the Sharpshooters of old, all while in full gallop on horseback."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_DISENGAGE}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MARKSMAN}

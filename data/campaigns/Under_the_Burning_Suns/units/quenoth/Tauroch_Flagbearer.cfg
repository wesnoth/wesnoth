    description= _ "The prestigious Flagbearers spend years out in the open deserts leading their brethren on patrols and hunts, where they forage for supplies while defending their villages from brigands. They are invariably masters of skirmishes and tactics, highly proficient at roaming through the inhospitable sands. Rarely the leaders of large villages or armies, Flagbearers nonetheless have the skill and charisma to act as generals in times of need, when the elves are threatened by something more than mere scavengers or wild beasts."

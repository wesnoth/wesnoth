    description= _ "It is told that once, an elf fleeing from an orcish hunting party came across a young stray tauroch on a small oasis. Understanding that neither meant any harm to the other, they are said to have fought side by side through a long night, driving off the orcs at sunrise. Afterwards, as the elf had mended the tauroch's wounds and finally collapsed from exhaustion, the beast had gently picked her up with its horns and carried back to her village.

Whether the story is true is unknown, but the loyalty and resolve of these mounts and riders both is undeniable."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_STEADFAST}

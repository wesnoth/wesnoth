    description= _ "In times past, turning and fleeing from an engagement was a risky tactic, for there were few means to avoid or block enemy archers shooting from behind. In the desert, however, unstable footing and lack of cover make it far more challenging for most fighters to strike from range. The elusive Pathfinders make use of this by riding the exceptionally agile dustboks, who are highly adapted to traversing the dunes and can evade most attacks with their swift movements. The difficulty in pinning these riders down often tries the patience of their enemies, who are provoked into recklessly giving chase â€” inevitably into many a deadly trap."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_DISENGAGE}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SLOW}

    description= _ "The massive and fearless Taurochs are often employed not only to charge and break through enemy formations, but to rally and inspire infantry to hold their ground. Vanguards are hardy riders, adept at surviving in the thick of battle and leading their brethren from the front lines. Towering above the rolling dunes, the Vanguards bear great flags that fly brightly in the desert skies, a distinctive sight even from far away across the sands. The presence of these riders is a heartening one for most elves and a deterrent for the many pillagers that rove the deserts."

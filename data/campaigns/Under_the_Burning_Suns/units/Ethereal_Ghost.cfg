	unit_description= _ "It is one of the greater mercies of creation that a human soul is immutable, and cannot be destroyed. However, the many things a necromancer can do, despite this, are entirely horrifying.

Trapped within a shroud of vile enchantments, a spirit likens unto the wind in the sails of a ship. The contrivance that results from this prison is an unfailing servant, which can be bound to whatever task their master sees fit.

Special Notes: Ethereal Ghosts have very unusual resistances to damage, and move quite slowly over open water. Unlike normal Ghosts, Ethereal Ghosts can also move through solid stone walls."

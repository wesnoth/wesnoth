    description= _ "Sometimes called the ‘hollow men’, spectres form the right arm of their master’s power. These abominations are a rightful terror to the living, and keep a sleepless vigil over their master’s domain.

The creation of these is no mean feat; the real danger in encountering one is that it is likely only the harbinger of a much more dangerous force that will follow in its wake."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_DRAIN}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SPIRIT}+_"SPECIAL_NOTE^ This unit is able to move through solid stone walls."

    description= _ "These tortured forms of what were once warriors are among the most terrifying things a necromancer can create, for a sword will cleave right through them, as through air itself. What inspires such fear is the thought that these beasts are invincible, a belief that is actually far from the truth.

Because of this, a means was made by which the enchantments that drive these creatures could renew themselves through the very thing which threatened them."

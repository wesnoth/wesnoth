    unit_description= _ "Sometimes called the 'hollow men', spectres form the right arm of their master's power. These abominations are a rightful terror to the living, and keep a sleepless vigil over their master's domain.

The creation of these is no mean feat; the real danger in encountering one is that it is likely only the harbinger of a much more dangerous force that will follow in its wake.

Special Notes: a strike from their blade will drain life from the victim, to renew the Spectre. Spectres have very unusual resistances to damage, and move quite slowly over open water. Unlike normal Spectres, Ethereal Spectres can also move through solid stone walls."

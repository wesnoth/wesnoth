Excerpt from the journal of Arne of Maghre:

Maghre is looking much better than the last time I saw it. Bjarn has done wonders in two years. The village is rebuilt, and the surrounding farmlands are restored and reoccupied. Despite my brother's worries, our people have faced no new threats in that time.

It has been more difficult to stay away in those two years, but I have my calling and Bjarn has his, and we have had little opportunity to meet again. But as the company and I are passing through this part of the kingdom with a new patron, I have asked leave of him to visit my brother and he gave it.

This patron is, of all things, an elf. I never thought I'd befriend one, but he is less arrogant the rest. Kalenz, he calls himself. He's seen too much; I can tell that just by meeting his eyes. I think we will have to work for our pay soon.

In the meantime, though, it's good to relax and enjoy the peace."

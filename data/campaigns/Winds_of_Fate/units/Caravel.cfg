    description= _ "The sturdy and reliable caravel is the mainstay of human oceanic exploration, shipping and projection of influence. More seaworthy than lighter vessels, one might yet be spied navigating deeper rivers, where the maneuverabilty and shallow draft somewhat compensate for the tonnage of the vessel.

While its modest speed compared to the vessels of other races makes evasion difficult, its tall fore and aft castles hold a powerful arsenal of ballistae to fend against pirate and sea monster alike.

The caravel can dock at coastal villages, though this makes it entirely vulnerable."

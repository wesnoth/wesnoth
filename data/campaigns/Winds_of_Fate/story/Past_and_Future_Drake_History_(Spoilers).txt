----  Time of Beginning  ----
Before two and a half million years ago.

The oldest time Drakes remember, when Irdya was in its natural fiery state.
Creatures native to Irdya thrive in this time; Arkhai (Fire Guardians) in the skies and trolls deep underground.
Drakes and other dragons thrive at Irdya's poles.




----  Time of Fate  ----
Begins two and a half million years ago.

Cataclysmic cooling of Irdya through the appearance of the enchanted Mists (Will of the Wisp).
Coinciding appearances of otherworldly flora and fauna from elsewhere- saurians, naga, mermish, dwarves, humans, and others.
Fae creatures appear soon thereafter, enchanted into being from these creatures- the woses from trees, the elves from humans, the nixes from mermish.

Arkhai greatly diminish in size and power and retreat to fiery sanctuaries underground and near volcanoes. Most Drakes move from the poles to the equator. Trolls begin to surface from the deep.
The warmth siphoned from Irdya by the Mists, along with the siphoned power and anguish of the diminishing Arkhai, is coalesced into the Ruby of Fire by the Fae.




----  Time of Legend  ----
Begins twenty two thousand years ago.

Irdya begins to warm with a slight waning of the Mists, through the feeble yet concerted efforts of the Arkhai.
Drakes come to rule over a great civilization of several races (themselves, Saurians and Dwarves), with toolworks unmatched in all later time.

A second civilization emerges shortly thereafter, of one race (Humans) with a likewise unmatched knowledge of magic, taught to them by the Arkhai.
An Arkhe further teaches the secrets of unlife to this second civilization and the practice of this art begins to consume the magical Mists that shroud Irdya, causing deserts and seas to grow.

Famine leads to a war between the two civilizations, which lasts two thousand years until a drake surrender.




----  Time of Turmoil  ----
Begins eleven thousand years ago.

Six thousand years of peace ensues, yet the famines grow more frequent as the deserts expand, until the practicers of unlife are too weak to stand against the Fae creatures that rise to defend the Mists.
The victorious Fae creatures then turn against all other races, stirred by the now alarmed Will of the Fae. Nearly all drakes are swept from the great continent and the dwarves are driven underground.

Finally, a league of drakes, dwarves and humans defeat the Fae creatures on the old continent and drive them into the sea.
They leave behind the Ruby of Fire, captured by the Drake Dominant Morogor.




----  Exile  ----
Five thousand years ago.

Seeing the harm the Ruby of Fire is inflicting on her forbidden mate, Drake Windshaper Witwegana has one of her gliders take it to a former ally during the war against the Fae, Lich-Lord Sowan.
However the Ruby is intercepted by Lich-Lord Lenvan, whom is already gradually preparing for total war against the living in the millennia of the far future, along with other younger Lich-Lords.

Witwegana sends word to her Morogor of this terrible error and races to confront Lenvan before he carries his new weapon into the underworld for careful centuries-long study.
Knowing she is hopelessly outmatched, Witwegana nevertheless challenges Lenvan to duel, buying precious time for Morogor's Wing to catch up.
Yet Morogor arrives late to find only the lifeless remains of his love. The slim fissures in his mind left by the Ruby are cracked open by the sight.

With the one-in-every-four of drakes loyal to him, Dominant Morogor puts Humanity and its Lich-Lords to the flames of his wrath; a betrayal of the former league of races against the Fae.
Honorbound to act, friend and fellow hero of the war, Enforcer Parapathos challenges Morogor to duel and defeats him, but refuses to end his friend's life, despite the protests of Lich-Lord Jevyan.
Morogor with all his followers are outcast into the sea by the league.
They settle in a distant chain of islands in the center of the Great Ocean; the new Domain of Morogor.

In his anguish, Dominant Morogor forbids the telling of all history preceding the Exile.




----  (This Campaign)  ----
3 to 4 YW

The events of this campaign.




----  War with Prey  ----
4 to ~20 YW

24 Flights totalling 30,000 drakes arrive on the Greatland (Great Continent) from 4 to 5 YW. Their initial effect is devastating to Wesmere, western Wesnoth and the Aethenwood.
However their military strategy is nonexistant, as they sweep wide and unfocused in a hunting pattern, not yet aware their "Prey" is capable and organized far beyond their imagining or willingness to accept.

By 9 YW heavily fortified cities in eastern wesnoth are striking out with massed cavalry against the isolated hunting camps of the thinly spread drakes.
They employ a Hammer-and-Anvil strategy by chasing and maneuvering isolated Wings and smaller Flights of drakes into ambushes by well positioned infantry at prearranged choke points.
Lintanir finally comes to the aid of the western elvish enclaves after defeating the four flights that invaded its realm.

Most Flights have been routed by 14 YW, retreating deeper into the continent in every direction.
The remaining Dominants in the western region coalesce their forces into a host of several thousand and begin to destroy human and elvish fortified settlements one at a time.
Their siege of the fortress city of Weldyn drags on until they find themselves exhausted and surrounded by an enemy reinforcement of similar numbers, which vanquishes them in a pitched battle.

There are only minor skirmishes until around 20 YW, when the remaining drake combatants retreat all at once into the wilds.
Their Dominants have been summoned to a grand counsel gathering by Gorlack, who convinces them of the immense failure the Ways of Morogor has wrought on the Great Continent.
They adopt the Ways of Gorlack and through it come to see their former "prey" as now honorable "Contenders" in what will be a centuries-long contest of leadership for the whole of the Continent.




----  Reemergence  ----
~20 to ~630 YW

Drakes reemerge from the wilds of the great continent with steadily increasing frequency and mysterious motives.
Despite the terrifying reputation left over from their first horrific appearance, they now engage in diplomatic actions with other races and are often a powerful ally to heroes of other races on their quests.
Indeed, a number of drakes (such as Krash) in this time period have come to respect the power and nobility of other species or individuals thereof.

At the same time, this new, enigmatic behavior pattern of the drakes slowly reveals signs of a structured, ruthlessly pragmatic strategy.
The odd alliances they form, the conflicts they suddenly abandon mid way through, the edicts and restrictions they place upon their protectorate states and vanquished enemies...
These maneuvers work to propel the Drakes' slow and steady rise towards a continent-spanning power.
An apex civilization to replace their long abandoned role as apex predator on old morogor.




----  Ascension  ----
~630 to ~900

With the destabilization and approaching collapse of the Kingdom of Wesnoth and the Northern Allliance, the races of these lands clamor for an end to the chaos of ascendancy wars and ruthless despots.
Many pledge fealty to the Drake Dominants and obedience to the Ways of Gorlack (a code of laws that has by now greatly expanded and drifted far from its original intent).
Formerly untouchable Warlords wake from their soft beds to the rumble of distant hooves and wings-- Knights with Dragons massed together, charging them at first light.

From this new power, a continent wide peace begins to emerge.
The most elite talents of the once disparate races are combined into wonders Irdya has not seen since the Time of Legend.
The craft of the Runesmith, the experiments of the Mage and the secrets long warded by the Clasher together yield metal beasts of burden powered by the combining of the opponent elements Fire and Water.
The towering bodies of mechanical warriors stirred to life by the same practice, help to keep the new Great Peace.

Yet it all comes at a price.
The Ways are a chokingly complex and ruthlessly enforced code of laws from which there is no escape for any one or any kind.
A universal, tyrant-less tyranny, where every action one takes could be an unwitting violation and the most harmless or well meaning infraction punished without understanding or mercy.

And despite so much law and security, an ancient menace grows between the cracks and under the foundation of the Great Peace.
Magic, the one remaining blind spot of the Drakes, the one power that still eludes their full comprehension, is about to supplant them.

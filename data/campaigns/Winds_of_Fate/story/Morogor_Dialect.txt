-- GRAMMAR RULES --

- No Compounding Sentences With 'And', 'Or', 'But' -
Generally prefer separate sentences. Even sentence fragments as separate sentences are welcome.
Use 'Yet', 'Also', 'Less So', 'More So', 'As Well' or ',' when compounding is needed.
("These creatures are feeble of body yet possessed of a limitless capacity for deceit.")
("We shall win the trust of this emperor. More so the adoration of his slaves.")
("Ignite their watchtowers, as well their bridges.")

- No Directly Asking Questions With '?' -
Questions can be put forward as imperatives ("You will speak to me every secret your mind holds.") These are generally never put to superior ranking Drakes.
Questions can be implied by statements ("I wonder as to the nature of their alliance.")

- Archaic -
Usually the most archaic meanings of words in the common tongue are used in the morogor drake dialect, due to its isolation for thousands of years.

-- GRAMMAR RULES --

-- Put every sentence on its own new line.
This reflects how drakes put more time and consideration into each individual sentence or sentence fragment, often taking a breath between them. And sometimes speaking with a kind of rhythm.

-- No compounding sentences with 'and', 'or', 'but'
Generally prefer separate sentences.
Sentence fragments as separate sentences are good.
When compounding is needed use: "yet", "also", "less so", "more so", "as well", ";" or ","
Examples:
"These creatures are feeble of body yet possessed of a limitless capacity for deceit."
"We shall win the trust of this emperor. More so the adoration of his slaves."
"Ignite their watchtowers, as well their bridges."

-- No contractions.
For examples, use "I shall" instead of "I'll" and "do not" instead of "don't".

-- No directly asking questions with "?"
Questions can be put forward as imperatives: "You will speak to me every secret your mind holds." (These are generally never put to superior ranking drakes.)
Questions can be implied by statements: "I wonder as to the nature of their alliance."

-- Use only "shall" for first person and only "will" for second and third person.
For example, "I shall lead them to victory." versus "You will lead them to victory."

-- Capitalize legally defined terminology when invoking the Ways.
Examples:
"Upon this isle, I hereby Proclaim my Eyrie."
"By the Ways of Morogor we Proclaim you Rogue."

-- Archaic meanings of words
Usually the most archaic meanings of words in the common tongue are used in the morogor drake dialect, due to its isolation for thousands of years.

There is a matter for which I must give counsel.

You heard resolutely, the Memory of our ancient exile to these sinking islands.
You have endured the shame of knowing Dominant Morogor's betrayal that made it so.
While the others of your caste revere this Ancestor, you alone shoulder the truth."

A Windpath of our own making."

There is a matter for which I must give counsel.

You have heard the Memory of our ancient exile to these sinking isles.

While the rest of your caste revere this Ancestor, you alone shoulder the truth."

I shall heed it.

A power within our hearts to which you will bear witness.
With it we shall part the turbulent Winds of Fate themselves.
Leaving in their place, a Windpath of our own making."

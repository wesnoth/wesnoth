There is a matter for which I must give counsel.

You have heard the Memory of our ancient exile to these sinking islands.
Endured the shame of learning it was Dominant Morogorâ€™s betrayal that made it so.
While the others of your caste revere this Ancestor, you alone shoulder the truth."

I shall heed them.

Yet set aside your fear, for there is also more to us than words can tell.
A power within our hearts to which you will bear witness.
With it we shall part the turbulent Winds of Fate themselves.
Leaving in their place, a Windpath of our own making."

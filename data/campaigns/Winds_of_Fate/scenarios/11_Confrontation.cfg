Only through defeat may some learn these creatures are much more than prey.

Verily, these creatures are fellow Contenders for dominance over the world itself.
With this greatland as our arena.
They are our equals until we <b>prove</b> ourselves their betters.

We shall need allies from among them in this great Contention.
Like our gentle saurians.
So too the deep dwellers with whom we have now a pax.

Our every move must be part of a grander design for victory.
In a Contention that will take a thousand years.
Yet by this windpath alone shall we rise to dominate the world once again."

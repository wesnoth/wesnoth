# HM_Master.map has a central location for the flight and is transformed into the maps for Heart_Mountains, Fire_Meets_Steel, Confrontation.
# This ensures the territory is identical between these scenarios, but allows covering different directions and changes like snow.
# 11_Confrontation.map is cropped to 48x38 saving the SW corner.

The wisdom Reshan whispered.
His gentle saurians.
Our truce with the deep dwellers.
Hunting only those creatures that do not hold weapons.
Honoring those that do by making full war upon them when the need arises.

It will take a thousand years.
Yet by this windpath alone we shall rise to dominate this world again."

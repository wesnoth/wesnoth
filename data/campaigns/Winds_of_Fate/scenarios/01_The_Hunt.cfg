Curious landbound creatures had been sighted on the Isle of Omarath. Faring across the ocean upon their wooden sea skimmers, they journeyed from beyond one side of the horizon to the other. Even the strongest of wing could not safely follow them so far as they went, lest they pass the point of no return. Just the same, the ancient glider caste had more than a notion of their destination."

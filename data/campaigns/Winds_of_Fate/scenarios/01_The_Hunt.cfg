            story= _ "One by one, the most desperate flights turned rogue. They broke the long peace among drakes by invading the domains of their neighbors. One by one, the rogues were destroyed by the honorable flights in accord with the Ways. Still more turned; two by two, then four by four. Soon enough there would be more flights to betray the Ways of Morogor than uphold them."

            story= _ "It was in this dark time the glider caste felt a familiar Windpath under their wings, a path newly recast from the twisting Winds of Fate. Curious landbound creatures had been sighted on the Isle of Omarath. Faring across the ocean upon their wooden sea skimmers, they journeyed from beyond one side of the horizon to the other. Even the strongest of wing could not safely follow them so far as they went, lest they pass the point of no return. Just the same, the ancient glider caste had more than a notion of their destination."

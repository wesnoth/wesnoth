I have found anoþer Aquadyne. It is here, deep beneaþ Þe Þree Sisters. It has only been þree years since Haldric destroyed þe elf gosts þat were sapping it and already þere is a mælstrom formed off þe norþ shore. Just like þose mælstroms Seeker Perþ discovered west of Alduin before a Wisp chased away his ship.

Indeed, þere must be an Aquadyne every twenty leagues around þe entire Great Continent. Everyþing is just as Seeker Oþila had predicted. We should never have left her behind on þe Green Isle. Wiþout her work it may take centuries before we of þe Silver Order know what mankind is dealing wiþ on þis continent. Þe Færie World is stronger here þan we ever imagined.


——Someþing is wrong. I am getting a signal of warning from þe norþwest watchtower and þere is smoke rising from þe souþern iland. Rhynnin’s expedition is under attack and I sense it is more þan just þe saurians. I must go to assist.

I do not have time to cypher þis log, nor can I risk taking my logbook wiþ me to perhaps be captured by an unknown enemy. Yet I shall not destroy it, þe secrecy of þe Silver Order be damned. May þe sea carry þis book back to Fort Elense so someone will know what has been discovered here." # no spellcheck

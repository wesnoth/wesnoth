            #po: "noble creatures" is a drake term for allies and potential allies
            #po: "legions" could also be "hordes", the English text uses a different word to avoid implying that it’s just orcs
            story= _ "Dominant Karron heard the Memories Spoken to her by the gliders. She led several flights west beyond Morogor to the distant Green Isle. Together with the noble creatures of this far land, she would strive to drive off the opposing legions so new eyries might be set there."

            story= _ "Countless drakes flocked from Morogor to scorch the Greatland with their need. Those creatures that survived their hunt formed large hosts with a deadly cunning. Soon, whole flights fell to their own prey. Others were scattered far across the Greatland as more poured over from Morogor to supplant them."

            #po: Future generations of drakes will argue over Gorlack’s real intentions. He diverts a thirst for victory into a time of peace, which would fit if his real intention is to create a lasting peace, but would also fit if the real intention is to bide time to prepare for war. As he’s the main player character, it's left to the player's imagination to read the meaning that they want.
            story= _ "As most grew weary of the hunt, Dominant Gorlack summoned all flights to a counsel gathering high upon his Sunreach Peaks. There, he shared with them a new Windpath, the <b>Great Contention</b>. By its wisdom, any creatures that spoke with an honest tongue, that respected the domain of another, that obeyed our Ways... might not be taken as prey. Such creatures would be justly feared as fellow contenders for world dominance."

            story= _ "In accord, the flights went again into exile, withdrawing to the Greatland’s many remote places. So ended the <i>War with Prey</i>."

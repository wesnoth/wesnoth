# Both sides are forced to recruit evenly (one of each type, then it repeats), to prevent
# recruiting only clashers or fighters, and for the player to gain experience using each unit type.
# Other drake recruits are encouraged by use of terrain that weakens clashers or strengthens non-clashers
#
# Data used for making clasher friendly map. Terrain usage numbers, covers all drake lines except sky & hurricane advancements.

# Sand, Hills, Mountain       1/40% all                         Mountains for border only, otherwise could slightly break immersion of playing field
# Fungus                      2/40% all                         Slowing version of hills/sand

# Forest                      1/40% b/f/g, 2/40% c              High defense slowing of clashers. Used on own or for enhancing shallow water/swamp slowing
# Unwalkable                  1/40% b/f/g, -/--% c              Use lava variety for illumination bonus for non-clashers
#
# Shallow Water               1/20% b/f, 3/20% c, 1/40% g       Shallow water is the barrier that keeps clashers to one side or the other
# Swamp                       1/30% b/f, 3/20% c, 1/40% g       Swamp is flat where we want to slow & weaken clashers
# Coastal Reef                1/30% b/f, 2/30% c, 1/40% g       Coastal reef is water where we want to strengthen clashers
#
# Deep Water                  2/20% b/f, -/--% c, 2/40% g       Prevents clashers and slows/weakens all others
# Frozen                      2/20% b/f, 3/20% c, 2/40% g       Like shallow water, but slows more than clashers, not used in a tropical environment

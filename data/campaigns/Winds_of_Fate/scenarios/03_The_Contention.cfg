# Both sides are forced to recruit evenly (one of each type, then it repeats), to prevent recruiting only clashers or fighters, and for the player to gain experience using each unit type.
# Other drake recruits are encouraged by use of terrain that weakens clashers or strengthens non-clashers.
#
# Data used for making clasher friendly map. Terrain usage numbers, covers all drake lines except sky and hurricane advancements.
# b=burner, f=fighter, c=clasher, g=glider

# Castle & Village            1/40% all                         No auxillary keeps or castles.
# Sand, Hills, Mountain       1/40% all                         Mountains for border only, otherwise could slightly break immersion of playing field.
# Fungus                      2/40% all                         Slowing version of hills/sand.

# Forest                      1/40% b/f/g, 2/40% c              High defense slowing of clashers. Used on own or for enhancing shallow water/swamp slowing.
# Unwalkable                  1/40% b/f/g, -/--% c              Use lava variety for illumination bonus for non-clashers.
#
# Shallow Water               1/20% b/f, 3/20% c, 1/40% g       Shallow water is the barrier that keeps clashers to one side or the other.
# Swamp                       1/30% b/f, 3/20% c, 1/40% g       Swamp is flat where we want to slow & weaken clashers.
# Coastal Reef                1/30% b/f, 2/30% c, 1/40% g       Coastal reef is water where we want to strengthen clashers.
#
# Deep Water                  2/20% b/f, -/--% c, 2/40% g       Prevents clashers and slows/weakens all others.
# Frozen                      2/20% b/f, 3/20% c, 2/40% g       Like shallow water, but slows more than clashers, not used in a tropical environment.

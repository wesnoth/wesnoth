Year of Wirk 368, 7th Month

They elves wur back in the mushroom croft again, making dolly threats tae the laddies in that fancy tongue of thairs. Said thay wid attack if we gather ony mair wood tae feed oor mushrooms, it does nae even maiter if it be juist the pine!

Hud the laddies pat up gates tae keep they elves oot fur now.

If thay dae come back with an airmie we cannae handle, we hae flashpowder kegs aroond the load bearing walls. They elves ur sae impressed with that cute “magic” of thairs— think of the looks oan thair faces whin thay see dwarven kencraft at wirk!

Still, oor woodcutters cannae harvest ony mair mushroom fodder oot of the forest withoot elves chipping away at thaim and the lodestane mines ur nearly tae the end of thair veins.

Mibbie ah shuid trade this cave tae that streenge “Nova” cratur efter all. Whit ever it be ah dae nae care; if the elves ever come back then thay kin deal with it."

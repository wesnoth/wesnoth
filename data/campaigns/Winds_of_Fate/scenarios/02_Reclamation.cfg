            message= _ "...that a fearsome war between drakes is fast approaching.

Each flight is led by a ‘dominant’ and advised by three ranked intendants. Beneath these are aspirants, whose position is like a princeship except their ascension to dominant is decided by contest. There is also a caste system that cuts across the flights, with four castes—

— Burners are strategic thinkers and show special concern for their fellow drakes. They are natural leaders. But prideful and prone to losing sight of the little things that grow into defeat.

— Clashers are trusted by all to fairly enforce the Ways of Morogor. They guard the drake hatcheries, and also libraries of secret knowledge engraved into ceramic tablets. They keep these secrets not just from us, but from the <i>other castes</i>.

— Fighters are bold. Quick thinking but decisive to the point of shortsightedness. They are our biggest trouble here.

— Gliders have a curious mind steeped in the ‘Spoken Memories’, a kind of oral history unknown to the other castes. As scouts, messengers, and stewards of the hunting grounds, they know Morogor is sinking. But the other castes ignore their warnings.

A young glider, Resha, told me her caste hopes to escape Morogor, and I suspect our arrival here may have encouraged them. Thankfully, Jessene keeps all her navigational charts under lock and key. If she hadn’t, the beating of dragon wings might be heard over Southbay!

Jessene says her people are familiar with these dragons. Their tomes describe such a race of monsters that drove the Wesfolk from the distant west. And the gliders too have stories of drakes living far beyond Morogor. Resha told me a few of these stories, before our parley was broken by another rebellion from the fighter caste.

26th day of the Eastward Oceanic Expedition</i>"

This cold lasts several moons."

can be of no consequence to our affairs.

No Ancestor would mistake such <i>prey</i> for an ally."

Makings for the mighty Automata down to their metal hearts that mix fire into water.
Witwegana's final words of affection to her mate before delaying Lenvan with a hopeless duel.

The wisdoms, the powers, the stories of our Ancestors.

These were once shared freely.
Until, anguished by our exile, Dominant Morogor forbade their telling.
Your Glider Caste alone would not comply.
By our Honor, we did.

Yet our written secrets quietly remained."

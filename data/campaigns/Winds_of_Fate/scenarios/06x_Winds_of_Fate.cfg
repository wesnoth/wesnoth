Much of it will grow as cold as a high mountain peak.
This cold lasts several moons."

Those ‘humans’ that graze upon the tall grass of the flatland,
that trick beasts to carry them across it,
that ride works of driftwood over the sea,
can be of no consequence to our affairs.

No Ancestor would mistake such simple <i>prey</i> for an ally."

Drakes once counted many noble creatures as allies in times of need — the fleetfoot, the drakekin, the craftlings, the serpents, the casters.

Likewise were there those of terrible natures — the Horde, the Jotnar... the Faerie.
I fear one of these races is they who swept our folk from this Greatland long ago."

The meandering way through the underland took by Parapathos in seeking the Council of Nine.
Makings for the mighty Automata down to their metal hearts that mix fire into water.
Witwegana’s final words of affection to her mate before delaying Lenvan with a hopeless duel.

The wisdoms, the powers, the stories of our Ancestors.

These were once shared freely among all drakes.
Until, anguished by our exile, Dominant Morogor forbade their telling.
Your glider caste alone would not comply.
By our honor, we did.

I thought we need only escape Morogor to fulfill our reascension from exile.

Its fearlessness.

We cut down any creature we find before us, even one another.
We become as one of the ancient foes — the Horde, the Jotnar, the Faerie... the Drakes.
Until we are surprised by defeat just as Dominant Morogor before us.
Because we shun all fear.

That is why our noble Ancestors exiled us.
Until we learn to temper our pride with fear we remain the creatures they exiled."

From the mouth of the cave, Parapathos witnessed the battle take a grim turn. As his wing struggled against the <i>nixes</i>, a living <i>mist</i> descended from the rolling stormclouds above the Crystal Sea. This ethereal creature was just as vast as Lenvan of the <i>casters</i> had warned. The great <i>mist</i> flew right to Dominant Morogor, who stood alone against it, steadfast to duel this creature of the Faerie.

With a chilled heart, Parapathos resumed his quest into the underland, leaving the lives of his friends to the fate of the battle. Never before had he resented the honor–burden of his clasher heritage. If not for it, he could have stayed to fight for them.

Echoes of the battle faded into silence as Parapathos descended through the cave. Sharp crystals jutted from the walls. Then the cave parted into a labyrinth of corridors. The same <i>craftlings</i> Parapathos sought had hewed these corridors before the Faerie creatures drove them down to Irdya’s very heart. Now he was lost in the labyrinth they left behind.

In the distance, Parapathos heard the heavy footfalls of <i>stonekin</i>. He followed them, for days, as they journeyed down to their chamber of contemplation. There they stopped altogether, standing solemnly in a circle around the chamber’s center. It seemed this was the bottom of the world, yet there was no <i>craftling</i> sanctuary to be found here. Perhaps they all had perished as Witwegana feared.

Yet there was a faint sound coming through the crystalline floor. It had the rhythm of <i>craftling</i> toolworks. Indeed their sanctuary had survived; it was right beneath him. Breaking through the floor, an entire realm was revealed below, sheltered within a great geode. Parapathos discarded his armor, unfurled his wings, then dove through the breach.

On his glide down, he saw many wonders lost to our folk since the Time of Legend. This realm was alive with myriad creatures the <i>craftlings</i> fashioned from metal. Its watch places sat not upon towers; they instead hung from great bubbles in midair. Strangest of all, the many torches that gave light to this realm did so without flame. This was indeed the ally our folk needed to turn the war against the Faerie.

There was a rumbling in the distance. Puffs of smoke rose from beyond the horizon. Then slowly they appeared, two hulking metal champions.

The drake automaton came first into view, as it was the swifter of the two. It bore a vague likeness to a <i>drakekin</i>, yet wingless, tailless. Below its four legs were rollers in place of feet. It breathed a menacing black smoke as its metal shell gleamed like golden sunlight.

Then the <i>craftling</i> automaton came into view. Like its creators, it was smaller, slower. The rollers that carried it were covered by curious metal feet that turned to meet the ground as it went along. It breathed a fair, nigh cloudlike smoke.

The automata took their places in the arena, facing each other. Their inner toolworks clamored ceaselessly. The call was given to begin the duel.

With a deafening shriek, the drake automaton spat out walls of flame, as it lurched ahead. Even the sand seemed to burn before it, as a dark odious smoke cloaked half the arena. Then the <i>craftling</i> automaton emerged from the thick of the smoke, to the flank of its opponent. With its spin hammer it mangled loose a roller from its victim. Despite this, the drake automaton managed to come about, then struck back with its battering ram to crush its foe’s wielder chamber, along with the poor <i>craftlings</i> inside.

It seemed a fateful blow. Until the <i>craftling’s</i> automaton rolled back, took aim with its fire staff, then shot loose the flame spitter from the drake’s. As their automaton caught fire, the clasher wielders emerged from within its wreckage. They went to the <i>craftling</i> automaton to honor their victorious opponents. Yet no <i>craftlings</i> emerged from it to receive their praise. Neither to gloat as <i>craftlings</i> often do.

A <i>craftling</i> runesmith strode onto the arena, laughing as he went. He told the bewildered clashers there was no one within his automaton, no one wielding its inner workings. By his glyph–making he had granted this thing a Will of its own. Turning again to the automaton, the clashers gave it a humble nod.

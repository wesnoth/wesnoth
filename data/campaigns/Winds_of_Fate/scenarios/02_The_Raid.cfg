            message= _ "...there is a war brewing between the drakes. And they think their stern laws can stop it. According to these <i>Ways of Morogor</i>, any Flight caught violating another's domain forfeits all their rights. Which leaves the violator to be put down by their neighbors and their precious hunting grounds divied up.

Each Flight is led by a 'Dominant' and advised by three ranked Intendants. Beneath these are Aspirants. Their position is like a princeship, but ascension to dominant is decided by contest. There is also a caste system that cuts across the flights, with four castes--

-- Burners are strategic thinkers and show special concern for their fellow drakes. They are natural leaders. But prideful and prone to losing sight of the little things that grow into defeat.

-- Clashers place the Ways before all else; more rule bound than even islefolk. They guard the drake hatcheries. As well as libraries of secret knowledge written on pottery eggs; these they guard not just from us, but from the <u>other castes</u>. Strange.

-- Fighters are brave. Bold even. Quick thinking but decisive to the point of shortsightedness. They are our biggest trouble here. But I find something admirable in them. Hard to describe really.

-- Gliders have a curious mind steeped in somekind of oral history. A history unknown to the other castes. As scouts, messengers, and stewards of the hunting grounds, they know Morogor is sinking. But the other castes ignore their warnings.

A young glider, Reshan, told me his caste hopes to escape Morogor. Our arrival here may have inspired them. I cannot let them see our navigational charts or the beating of dragon wings will be heard over Southbay!

One more thing. These creatures are not unfamiliar to my people. Our ancient tomes describe such a race of monsters; the ones that drove us wesfolk from our homeland in the distant west. And the gliders too have stories of drakes living far beyond these islands. Reshan told me a few of these stories, before our parley was broken by another rebellion from the fighter caste.

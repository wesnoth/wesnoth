Indeed, Ã¾ere must be an Aquadyne every twenty leagues around Ã¾e entire Great Continent. EveryÃ¾ing is just as Seeker OÃ¾ila had predicted. We should never have left her behind on Ã¾e Green Isle.

----SomeÃ¾ing is wrong. I am getting a signal of warning from Ã¾e norÃ¾west watchtower and Ã¾ere is smoke rising from Ã¾e souÃ¾ern iland. Rhynnin's expedition is under attack and I sense it is more Ã¾an just Ã¾e saurians. I must go to assist.

I do not have time to cypher Ã¾is log, nor can I risk taking my logbook wiÃ¾ me to perhaps be captured by an unknown enemy. Yet I shall not destroy it, Ã¾e secrecy of Ã¾e Silver Order be damned.

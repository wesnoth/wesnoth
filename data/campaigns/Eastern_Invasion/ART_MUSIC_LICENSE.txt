PORTRAITS

addoggin (The_Gnat)
    https://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?t=44783&start=75
    this... doesn't have an official license.  Is there any policy for stuff posted on the forums?
    if The_Gnat isn't contactable or doesn't want to release under a CC license, this portrait can easily be swapped with a generic bandit portrait

dolburras (eyerogue) - GPL3
    https://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?t=29389&start=120

mage-white-female2 (kitty)
    https://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?t=21336&start=30
    this one doesn't have an official license either; it's a modified (by dalas) version of one of kitty's draft white mage portraits
    not sure what the policy is on this, since it was made with the express purpose of being used for mainline wesnoth but never got added
    if that's a problem, it's easy to substitute for the generic white mage portrait (honestly I'm not sure why I went through the trouble to get a different version for a character who only speaks 2 lines)

    modified by dalas; I release my modified image under CC BY 4.0 (if I'm legally allowed to do that)
    another intended-for-mainline portrait from the forums with no license
    can be removed from the campaign if that's an issue; this portrait is only used for 2 unit types that only show up in the final scenario (and it's not that pretty anyway)

    #
    # many of these achievements are intended as content guides, teasing the player with things like "recruit the dunefolk" or "ally with the dwarves"
    #    this helps players find content they might have missed
    #
    # but some achievements are VERY hard. Frenzied and Warmonger, for example.
    # they are, at least, theoretically possible. But I would be very impressed if someone could achieve them on hard
    #    (that's why it's called an "achieve"-ment, yeah?)

#
# This is intended to be a difficult mission, moreso than the next few.
# I think high difficulty is necessary to establish the undead (and particularly Mal-Ravanal) as a credible threat.
#
# At first, this scenario is pretty easy. The enemies have low gold and low income.
# But once Mal-Ravanal shows up, things get dangerous:
#    1) this (hopefully) makes the player fear Mal-Ravanal right off the bat
#    2) this establishes the undead invasion as a credible threat.
#
# In my expeience, the best strategy is to push forward and gather XP in the first half,
# then give ground after Mal-Ravanal shows up, during the second night.
# You need to have enough units/hp to push forward during the third day.

    # wmllint: local spelling Galdren Ravan
    [story]
        [part]
            story= _ "Before we begin our council, I must tell you all the history of this lich we face. He was at first a mage of the realm, like me, and his fall began during the reign of Haldric VII..."

        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "The greatest seer in the land, Galdren, foresaw that some day, some day soon, a great evil would spread over the land. The king, naturally, was worried. The seer told him that the only way to stop the evil was to appoint a mage, versed well in combat with the spirits of darkness, to be the king’s advisor."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "In all the land, there were two magi that clearly stood out from the rest. A mage from the east named Ravan, and myself. The King, wishing to choose the best advisor, sent us both before Galdren. Then he conversed with the seer privately. None know what was said, but when he came out he announced that the seer was dead, and he had chosen me as his new advisor."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "Ravan took this quietly enough, we all thought, but now I think that this was when he began his fall. He went deep into conversation with the spirits of darkness, hoping to discover their weaknesses. But it was they who found his."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "One day, Ravan returned to the castle where I was living. He demanded to see me and the guards let him in, for then he was still a well-respected mage. When I greeted him, he named himself Mal-Ravanal and challenged me to a duel."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "His attack was swift and his power great, but through unwavering faith and no small skill I emerged victorious. As he lie there mortally wounded I prepared to excise the darkness in his soul."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "But I hesitated too long... He simply vanished, teleported away. The mage Ravan died that day; yet death is a mere inconvenience to those most skilled in the arts of necromancy..."

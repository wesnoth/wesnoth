# 2 options - west or east
#
# west is easier: flat terrain, and you can win before Mal-Kallat's forces catch up to you
#    but leads to the low-reward Elven Interlude
# east is harder: fighting bats/ghosts in difficult terrain, and Mal-Skraat's forces will catch up to you
#    but leads to the high-reward Bitter Swamp and Mal-Ravanal's Capital

    # -------WILDLANDS GOAL NOTES:
    # this is a long campaign, and I wanted to avoid it feeling tedious
    # so, the wildlands arc (placed at the campaign's middle) has a lot of unusual mechanics, to try and make these scenarios feel different from normal scenarios
    # S09 has "frostbite" and several events, S10 has a split army with many events, and S11 is heavily scripted.
    # the income changes hopefully put emphasis on gold rather than army, and being frugal rather than rushing for an early finish (there are no early finish bonuses)
    #

    #
    # -------WILDLANDS INCOME NOTES:
    # wildlands scenarios all have 100% carryover and 0 starting gold (except for S08 with some starting gold, and S12 with 40% carryover)
    # in S09, Dacyn warns you to conserve your gold, but even if you spend recklessly it's extremely difficult to make a subsequent scenario unwinnable:
    #     S08 (Xenophobia) requires you to end with at least 300 gold
    #     S09 (Castle In The Ice) needs few recruits and only has a single-tile castle. You'd have to try pretty hard to go broke.
    #             plus there are several gold pickups lying around
    #             this scenario has no time limit (i.e. no early finish bonus), but few villages and continual cold damage, to hopefully prevent abuse
    #     S10 (Dark Sanctuary) is a bit of a gold-eater, but even if you spend everything now, S12 is still winnable with 0 gold
    #             there's also gold just inside the gate (wyvern), ensuring that even if you spend everything immediately, you still have enough gold to resist the orcs
    #             this scenario has no time limit (i.e. no early finish bonus), but few villages and increasing enemy spawns, to hopefully prevent abuse
    #     S11 (Captured) has no need for recruiting
    #             this scenario has no time limit so you can farm infinite xp, but without any gold you won't be able to bring leveled recalls through S12
    #             so it's in the player's best interest to rush the exit as quickly as possible
    #     S12 (Evacuation) is beatable without any recruiting - just run straight for the bridge
    #             but S08-S11 gold conservation pays off here, letting you recruit a large army and potentially save all your leveled recalls

#
# if the player is already struggling, this scenario is easy. With no recall list, you can win by just rushing Gweddry/Owaec/Dacyn acrosss
# and if you have a single castle of worthwhile recalls, it's still fairly easy to get across
#
# but a veteran player with a huge recall list will have difficulty getting everyone across the bridge safely, because of both the gold costs and the time limit
# this is designed to equalize things a little bit, and make it a little harder for a player's recall list to snowball out of control
#

#
# the extremely low turn limit is to discourage winning via killing enemy leaders.
# while killing enemy leaders is an option, it bypasses the ending cutscene and feels against the spirit of the scenario
# instead, players are encouraged to rush across the bridge as quickly as possible, which takes far fewer turns than direct combat
#
# low turn limit also discourages using the bridge chokepoint to farm excessive kills

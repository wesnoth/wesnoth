# Terrain configuration file. Defines how the terrain _work_ in the game. How
# the terrains _look_ is defined in terrain_graphics.cfg. The background color
# of terrain type icons is determined by the terrain type color ranges in
# ./team-colors.cfg.

# NOTE: terrain id's are used implicitly by the in-game help:
# each "[terrain_type] id=some_id" corresponds to "[section] id=terrain_some_id"
# or "[topic] id=terrain_some_id" identifying its description in [help].
# It also corresponds to [color_range] id=some_id in team-colors.cfg.

# NOTE: this list is sorted to group things comprehensibly in the editor
# NOTE: this data is parsed by data/tools/terrain2wiki.py yo generate
# the TerrainCodeTableWML wiki page.

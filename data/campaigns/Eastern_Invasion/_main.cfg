    #
    # ----DIFFICULTY NOTES:
    # for most scenarios in this campaign, there is little player gold variation and enemy gold variation provides the variation between difficulties
    # this is for 2 main reasons:
    #    1) scenarios are easier to balance when there's fewer variables
    #    2) I want the campaign to feel as similar as possible despite varying difficulty
    #       e.g. Giving extra gold or increasing the turn limit can change a small skirmish (on hard) into a big-army battle (on easy)
    #       e.g. Reducing an ally's gold on high difficulty can make them feel useless, which is not my intention for any of the scenarios with allies
    #
    # my goal is for Easy/Normal/Hard difficulty to be 20%/60%/100%; that is to say Easy has 1/5 as many enemies as Hard, and Normal has 3/5 as many
    #    this may not always translate directly to 20/60/100 gold/income, since enemies with many villages effectively have a higher guaranteed income
    #    also, remember that [side] {INCOME} doesn't include everyone's base +2 income
    #    and also, some optional "challenge" scenarios have reduced scaling (e.g. All-In), since they're intended as challenges and easily avoidable
    #

    #
    # ----STRUCTURE NOTES:
    # broadly speaking, this campaign can be divided into 3 sections
    #     I've tried to keep each section different both narratively and mechanically, so that the campaign doesn't feel stale (it's pretty long)
    #
    # S01-S07, Gweddry and Co are trying to keep their little band of soldiers alive through initial stages of the undead invasion
    #    regular battles, focused around building up a recall list while achieving bonus objectives (Hahid, Terraent, Yannic)
    # S08-S12, Gweddry and Co are in the northlands, dealing with the Chief Dra-Nak subplot and trying to get Dacyn's amulet
    #    cramped and/or small battles, focused around looting items and saving enough gold to keep your recalls alive in S12
    # S13-S18, Gweddry and Co are witnessing a dying Wesnoth, and finally fighting as part of a proper army in a full-fledged war
    #    big battles, where your performance in S01-S12 determines how successful you'll be
    #
    # the campaign is designed with lots of easy-or-hard branching decision points, where one option is easier but the other option has better rewards
    #    S12 "Evacuation" also functions as a decision point - you're guaranteed a win even if you don't recruit any units, but the fewer recalls escape the more difficult the future will be
    #    players should be able to complete the campaign by taking only the easy, lower-reward options, culminating in the easier finale S17a "The Duel"
    #    but only players who've succeeded at some challenges will have a strong enough army to complete the more difficult finale S17b "All-In"
    #

    #
    # ----AI NOTES:
    # many scenarios have AI that's scripted to retreat during the daytime, and to regroup when low on unit count
    #     partially for balance, but also because it (IMO) makes for more interesting ebb-and-flow gameplay
    # some scenarios also have ally AI that's scripted to play defensively, with [avoid]s to keep it from being too aggressive
    #     partially for balance, but mostly so that you aren't silently cursing your allies every turn
    # therefore, before altering terrain, please check if it messes with AI behavior (e.g. AI tries to retreat to a village that's no longer there)

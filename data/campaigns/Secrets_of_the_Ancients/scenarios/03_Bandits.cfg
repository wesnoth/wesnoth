Even with the delay at the graveyard, I reached the outskirts of Llorvin at first light, and it was far behind me when the sun rose above the mountain peaks. I doubt the Academy will be looking for me in the trackless wilds inhabited only by woodcutters, and with my new companions, I feel safe enough to travel during the day. I am heading east and then north towards the docks. A ship should be leaving for Blackwater Port in a few days, and I mean to be on it."

# Walkthrough tip if you have trouble: Use walking corpses. Recruit about five, including
# a soulless or two. Make more at every opportunity: two or three per turn. You need the
# enemy to attack their former soldiers instead of your leveled ones.

We reached the Ford of Abez as the dawn light spread behind the mountain peaks to the north. As we waded across, the dark water reached to our waists, which made for slow going. I dared not imagine what manner of tentacled creature lurked below, but we completed the crossing without incident. The water was chill with snowmelt, so our teeth were chattering when we reached the far shore. The rising sun was warm though, and had us dried in short order. Despite this, Ras-Tabahn was not well off. He collapsed in the sand and went into a paroxysm of coughing the like of which I had never seen. When he could speak again, he assured me that it was only on account of the cold, and I should not be unduly troubled. I am uneasy all the same."

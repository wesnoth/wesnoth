Rastaban seems like an acceptable ally. He is quite different from the stodgy teachers at the academy who were so full of themselves and loved to hear themselves talk. He also never once disparaged me for being a girl or even mentioned my hair. As long as he continues to respect me, everything will go fine. If not, well, I am surrounded by the remnants of those who assumed I was weak."

I could easily imagine great siege engines heaving stones at walls that were now crumbled ruins, and the clash of combatants who were now bleached white bones jutting from the wreckage."

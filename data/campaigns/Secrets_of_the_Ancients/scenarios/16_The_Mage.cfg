# Two events in the "play" section are to remove four HP from Ras-Tabahn each turn. (He
# is suffering from tuberculosis.) There are some mages who put holy water around
# Crelanu. The water destroys undead, but can be removed by living units. It is there
# to prevent easy assassination of Crelanu with a few specters.

# This is slightly hackish since the closer contains VAR_NAME...

We crossed the high plateaus, and forded the Arkan-thoria. Then we headed up into the mountains again before we found the mage. This was Ras-Tabahn’s plan, and with the goal in sight, he gained a little strength. However, he is quite weak and ill now, and breathing raggedly. I don’t know how much longer he can survive."

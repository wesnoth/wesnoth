# At the end of this scenario, Ras-Tabahn and his army and gold have to be stored so they
# can be brought back when R-T rejoins Ardonna. There is some dialog about having at
# least 50 gold because that's probably necessary to win Entering_the_Northlands on hard.
# EtN is the next scenario chronologically, but not the next in the game, so having to
# come all the way back to this scenario for more gold would be annoying--hence the tip.
# You get the ability to recruit chocobones when a unit inspects the bones of a
# flightless bird half-buried in the sand. There is one long event for this. Almost the
# same event appears in Mountain_Pass if the player doesn't find the bones here.

# Several enemies are placed on the map at the start. Three others are placed later on
# specific turns. It is possible for the player to occupy their castles before they
# appear, or wait nearby to assassinate them before they can recruit. This strategy will
# backfire as the leader will get at least a castle's worth of units a turn earlier in
# this case. Several events and macros control this. (About half of this file actually.)

# This is slightly hackish since the closer contains VAR_NAME...

From the northern part of the kingdom of Knalga, the tunnel split into many passageways. Being able to feel the life force of the dwarves allowed us to take mostly unoccupied tunnels, which we did."

We finally made it out of the mountains. We crossed the Ford of Abez late this morning, and hiked the rest of the day south-east, making for the town of Tath. We planned to split up there. I was going to go south to Dan’Tonk and Weldyn to spread our news, and Ras-Tabahn was to head toward Elensefar to carry out his plan of carving out a special place for us in the world. (And becoming some sort of king as well I suppose.)"

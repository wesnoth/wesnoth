# If the bird bones were not found on the beach, then you get the ability to recruit
# chocobones when a unit inspects the bones of a flightless bird half-buried in the snow.
# There is one long event for this. If the bones *were* found earlier, this event is
# removed in the prestart event.

We have reached a pass through the mountains that Ras-Tabahn knew of. The air is cool in these upper reaches. Mist rises from the snow in the afternoon, and the icicles drip the purest water from rock overhangs. I find it all refreshing, but Ras-Tabahn’s coughing fits are frequent. Sometimes he is reduced to speaking in short phrases due to lack of breath. Of course he is quite old — 50 at least — but I am also certain that he is ill. His thinness leads me to believe it is consumption, but he refuses to discuss it, preferring to deny the severity of his problem."  #po: "consumption" is an old word for tuberculosis

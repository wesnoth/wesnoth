# During the opening, characters move in and out of the trapdoors leading below decks,
# and into the passenger cabin doors as well. Macros open and close the various doors as
# necessary. A menu item is provided to remove the terrain image that
# contains the ship's sails. The macro for that is in utils because it is also used for
# the next scenario. The ship terrain is fairly complicated, but the terrain files have
# more details. The ship is the reason for SotA-only bats: Normal bats are drawn above
# all terrain, but that looks wrong with the ship sails, so SotA bats are drawn on a
# lower z-level.

Research sometimes requires experiments, so I began. I forced my will into the life-force pathways of the bandit, thus turning him into my puppet. He resisted, but on account of my recent practice, my will proved the stronger. More strangely, the inside of his body also resisted, attacking me, the invader. However, since I wasn’t physically there, it ended up attacking itself! Over a period of hours, slabs of flesh became weak and threatened to fall off his frame. I was obliged to stitch them in place."

I stitched on muscles where they seemed to fit, and used enchantments to improve the bonding, thus improving the strength of the creature. At first, each new piece of flesh caused another violent reaction from the body’s defenses. Eventually, the reactions weakened, and the body stabilized in its new configuration, though by this time it was suppurating and unrecognizable. The mind inside gibbered at what it had become, but the bandit had wished for me a fate worse than death, so it didn’t seem unfair."

Then, I made my way to the docks, and under the cover of night, loaded my army into the hold of the waiting ship. The following afternoon, I embarked as a normal passenger."

The journey started well enough, but on the dawn following our departure, the wind died completely, and we were stranded. There was enough food for the paying passengers for a couple days of this, but none for my companions, and the living ones soon got hungry. When one of the crew disappeared on the second evening, I suspected the cause. I was not wrong."

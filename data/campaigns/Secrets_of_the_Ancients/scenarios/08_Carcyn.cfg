# We are switching to Ras-Tabahn for the next three scenarios. Ardonna and her recall
# list still exist and will be back later.

# Moving a unit to the jailhouse gets you two loyal, level-0 units. One is a ruffian, and
# the other is a female version of a ruffian called a delinquent. She can't level into a
# thug, but both of them can level into DAs. (This is recommended. You can evenually have
# a pair of loyal ancient liches if you take this option.) Winning the scenario also
# works to get these units.

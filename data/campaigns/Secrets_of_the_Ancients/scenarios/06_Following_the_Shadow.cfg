# A large number of bats spawn in the cave under these two conditions:
# (1) Six non-bat units are in the cave (Bats don't stomp on the floor.)
# (2) Ardonna has been in the cave for two turns in a row. (That gets her solidly into
#     the cave, but not close to the exit. If she is alone, it's the player's fault when
#     the bats kill her.)

I was so sure I had the answer! I was wrong. I wanted to believe that I was imagining it, but it’s now clear that the captain’s memories are fading. He still retains speech, and the others fight better when he is watching (many used to be his crew after all — it would be habit for them), but he remembers precious little else now. The same is true of my other recently-raised friends. I am disappointed, but the existence of my strange new companion keeps me from being depressed."

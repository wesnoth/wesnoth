The tunnel at the back of the cave narrowed and ran on for quite some time. Patches of fungus on the wall gave off a feeble glow that kept me from stumbling too badly. Finally I saw a brighter light up ahead."

You see the blades Vash-Gorn carries? It took a complicated ritual to bind that metal to the spirit, and one couldn’t perform that ritual oneself without a physical body. Being unable to interact with the world would be terribly frustrating. No matter; I have another idea."

The question is whether or not we can work together. Listen. The ancient Wesfolk honed their craft over generations. There is more to know than one individual can learn in a lifetime. If you do your research alone, you will one day be as old as I, and death will pursue you just as relentlessly. However, if we combine our research, we have a chance of finishing before it is too late for us."

Meanwhile, I am going to try to train some local peasants in the magical arts. I don't expect much from that uneducated rabble, but hopefully some will be intelligent enough to add to our firepower. When we reunite, you will show me how to make one of those shambling ghouls. I am actually in no hurry, as they have a terrible odor."

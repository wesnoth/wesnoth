# -------------
# Conventions for SoTA Scenario Files:
# There are four sections to most scenario files. The first is story, map, side
# definitions, and schedule. Then there is prestart, play, and opening/ending. These
# three sections are clearly marked. Prestart just has the prestart event. Opening/ending
# contains most of the dialog and the scenario-ending events. Play has everything else.
# Macros are usually defined right before the event in which they are used. However, if
# they are very long or used in more than one section, they get their own marked section
# just before prestart. If they are used in more than one scenario, they go in sota-utils.
# -------------

# The placement of enemies in this scenario is carefully adjusted rather than totally
# random. That's why there are so many macro calls. Wild animals can't pass through
# fences. To block them, we use a custom terrain overlay (code: ^Fync). It is a copy of
# the core fence, except that it is an alias of unwalkable. Bats are unaffected because
# they are flying, and Ardonna gets an object that lets her go through unwalkable terrain
# until the end of this scenario.

9 XII, 22 YW:

It’s unfair that we humans must die after so few years. Elves and dwarves live far longer. Though this may be the natural order, we need not embrace it! The lords on the Green Isle knew how to live forever. Pursuit of that knowledge was declared illegal by King Haldric I, but I believe it is worth the risk. As I watched my family waste away of various maladies, I vowed that I would not share their fate, and if I can rediscover the secrets of the ancients I will be a hero to the whole continent! I shall begin research in earnest this winter."

My experiments with bats have proven unfruitful. I have determined that they do not truly drain the life force of their victims — it is an illusion. The loss of blood weakens the victim, while the bat gains vitality because it has fed. There is nothing I can learn from bats about extending life. Now I have a problem. I am forced to keep the bats and pretend they are my pets because I cannot admit why I was studying them. In truth, it is not a burden — I have grown somewhat fond of the creatures, and I don’t mind appearing eccentric. I am already marked as different because my hair is so light, and I lack a sense of smell."

Today, headmaster Aimucasur himself taught a class on moving objects with one’s mind. The technique involves projecting one’s will inside the item, and then learning to move it as an extension of the body. Incantations focus the mind to the task. We practiced with inanimate objects, but clearly the same principle could be applied to unliving flesh. Nobody dared voice the thought, because showing interest in the necromantic arts results in expulsion. I was pondering that fact in class when I noticed Aimucasur glowering at me. I must be more careful in the future about which of my thoughts appear on my face."

One of my bats must have been old, for it died. Boldly then, I decided to animate the corpse. I was pleased to see that it worked, but what was interesting was this: The first time the bat twitched, I felt a last spark of life energy flash through its body. I noted that it flowed through some kind of pathway. That gave me an idea. With my mind, I searched out all the life force pathways in its body using what I could sense in the living bats as a guide. Then I animated <i>them</i> all at once, and the bat slowly flapped off the floor on its own! (That is a trick old Aimucasur probably doesn’t know!) Even better, the energy running through the life force network seemed to maintain itself, so I didn’t need to continue to concentrate. Could this be the whole secret? Could all the ancient lords have had someone bring them back <i>after</i> death? I would need another mage I trusted completely, but perhaps I can find someone with whom to make a pact."

With further observation, I have determined that this is probably not the way to avoid death. The reanimated bat has no will! It does nothing unless I nudge it with my mind. Perhaps the will of a human is stronger, and someday soon I will have the opportunity to find out... because I’m quitting the Academy. I will be in my room when old Morvihn checks for the night, but not two hours later! I grow weary of this place and its restrictions on thought. So, no more brown initiate’s robes, no more being ridiculed on account of my hair, no more pompous instructors. I will teach myself the so-called “dark” arts and learn how to live forever! The ancients from the Green Isle found a way, so I can discover it too. When all these oldsters here find themselves breathing their last, they will have to beg me for the secret. Perhaps I will be generous. Perhaps not."

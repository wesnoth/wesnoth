We prevailed today on the field, but our victory was somewhat bitter. <i>Everyone</i> was afraid or angry and immediately attacked us instead of listening to our news. I realize now... the world is not ready for our knowledge. I give up on all of them. I am going to live in the old troll city and learn the applications of mountain fire. In some future time, less conservative attitudes will dominate, and I can certainly afford to wait. In the meantime, we are doing what we can to hasten that day."

# There is no leader for side 2, but the side starts with a canrecruit unit who leaves
# at the beginning. Woses spawn on many turns, but they are invisible on their forest
# hexes. So, in their first turn, they move one hex and tear up the dirt on their
# starting location. That way the player isn't totally surprised.

My primary objective was met, and I had been able to press a number of ghosts into service. Also, I had a new companion with a talent for healing. I doubted that Ras-Tabahn was already waiting at the appointed place, but I still wanted to hurry, so we followed the elf road north as quickly as we could. Fortunately, it was not in bad repair, though in many places it was overgrown, leaving only a few smooth cobbles to mark the way. The second day, we were still deep in the woods when we encountered an elf sorceress."

# Liches are now available to the player. All the stored units from the DA line need to
# have that option added to their unit trees. Since all dark sorcerers have been leveling
# into necromancers until this point, a menu option is included to turn them into liches
# too.

# The spiders nearest to the player start with no movement points, and get one added
# each turn for the first few turns. That keeps the spiders from swarming the player
# immediately, and lets the battle happen in the middle of the map. For difficulty
# levels other than hard, a few changes are made to the map that make the scenario
# a bit easier.

# The spiderweb terrain can be applied anywhere, but will be invisible if it is not used
# with specific shapes of corners or chasms. This limited the amount of artwork needed.

To become a lich, one must first die. The spells of necromancy bind the spirit, but only once it has been unbound from the body. To become a lich, the mage must make the necessary incantations with his dying breaths. He thus binds his own spirit in much the same way he binds the spirits of others... An altar serves to hold his soul in the physical plane long enough to make the transition, and a suitable object must be found to hold the consciousness for one crucial moment when the body expires."

So, Ras-Tabahn is now undead. In the beginning, his health was not much improved, and he complained of being cold. His life force was weak, but he was able to absorb life from the rats infesting the ancient castle. Now he is more strong and vigorous than I have ever seen him. This is despite the fact that his flesh is starting to rot away, a process that causes him no discomfort. Nor can he smell it any more than I can. If all continues to go well, I will make the transition soon myself."

Now the process is complete for both of us. I posted a guard so nothing could happen to me in my weakened state, and nothing did. I am restored. I don’t feel much different, but I suppose I look a fright. Ah well, it can’t be helped. But my primary goal is achieved! I cannot die! I suppose I could be broken apart like a skeleton or maybe burned, but I do not have to fear these unlikely events: I have the awesome powers of the spirit realm flowing through me, and can protect myself quite adequately! My next goal is to share my knowledge with the world so that <i>no one</i> need die."

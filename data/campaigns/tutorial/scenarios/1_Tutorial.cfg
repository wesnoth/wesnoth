When a unit gets enough experience (the experience bar is the smaller bar on the right), it will go up a level. Elvish Fighters have two options, and you will get to choose which one you want. Note that level 2 units cost you twice as much to support as level 1 units."

Once you select a unit, you see percentages for different places: higher means more defensible. For example, defence is good in castles and villages, bad inside rivers. The dummies' attacks are magical, however, so they have a 70% chance of hitting you wherever you stand."

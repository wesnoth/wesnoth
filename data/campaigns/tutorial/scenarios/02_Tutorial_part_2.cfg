In this case, the Elvish Shaman has the Heal ability, which allows her to heal allied adjacent units 4 hitpoints at the start of each turn. Unit types with abilities, especially ones like Heal, can be very useful, so be careful when sending them into battle.

Weapon specials are special attack modifiers that make certain attacks more powerful. Once again, in this case, the Shaman has the Slows special on her entangle attack. When this attack is used on an enemy, it will halve the damage they do for one turn. Other weapon specials include First Strike, which allows that attack to always hit first no matter who attacks first, and Magical, which gives that attack a constant 70% chance to hit.

A full list of abilities and weapons specials, along with traits, may be found in help."

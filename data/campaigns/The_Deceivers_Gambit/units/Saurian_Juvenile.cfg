    description= _"These young saurians are less than a year old, and are too weak and infirm to hunt or fight. Older Juveniles may tend to a few basic duties within their clutch, but are still defenceless in combat. As these saurians grow older, they will quickly learn to fend for themselves and become fully grown adults by the age of three."

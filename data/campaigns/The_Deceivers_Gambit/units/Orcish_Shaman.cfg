    description= _ "Like most sapient races, orcs often ponder the workings of the world in which they live. Some endeavor to take this beyond idle musing, but the violent, nomadic lifestyle of the largest orcish clans does not lend itself to academic study, and the rare scholarly orc is invariably killed or enslaved by their more warlike brethren.

Orcish shamans are rare exceptions to this rule. Respected among clans and seen as a trustworthy and neutral party, shamans serve as guardians of orcish wisdom, and advisors in times of crisis — not something orcs tend to otherwise tolerate. By the time an adept is recognized as a fully-fledged shaman, she has committed to memory much of the orcs’ collective oral tradition. This much-practiced wisdom has many applications, not least of which is their improved ability to draw life from their foes during battle."

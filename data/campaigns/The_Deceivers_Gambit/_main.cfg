# Delfador wields more magic than other mages seen in Wesnoth.
#   part of that is because you don't see the other mages "up close"
#      i.e. when your silver mage gets lucky and dodges 3 attacks in a row, maybe he actually cast "shield"
#   and perhaps other mages focus less on war and more on study - scientists rather than engineers, so-to-speak
#   but on top of that, Delfador's just a magical prodigy.
#       in addition to his schooling, he's gained a lot of magical knowledge from his experiences with Elende, orcish shamans, Omaranth, etc
#       he's also learned a great deal from his time with Methor (one of the masters at Alduin - quite powerful himself!)
#
# I'm imagining TDG part-1 Delfador to be 20-30, TDG part-2 Delfador to be 45-55, and HttT Delfador to be 60-70
# that's a bit of a stretch at both ends of the time scale, but I think it's plausible

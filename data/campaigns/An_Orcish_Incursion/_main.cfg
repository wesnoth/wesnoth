# Geographical and historical assumptions (ESR):
#
# As originally written by Josh Parsons, this campaign was not set in
# any particular time or place.  I changed it to a few years after the
# arrival of orcs on the Great Continent, and pinned it to the
# northern marches of Wesmere.  Erlornas and his troops were originally
# professional guards, but I've changed them to a scratch force of
# civilians raused by a local noble and gradually militarizing.  Thus,
# this becomes a story of how elves learned the nature of orcs and how
# to cope.

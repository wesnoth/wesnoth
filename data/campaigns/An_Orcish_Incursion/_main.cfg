    # Geographical and historical assumptions (ESR):
    #
    # As originally written by Josh Parsons, this campaign was not set in
    # any particular time or place.  I changed it to a few years after the
    # arrival of orcs on the Great Continent, and pinned it to the
    # northern marches of Wesmere.  Erlornas and his troops were originally
    # professional guards, but I've changed them to a scratch force of
    # civilians raused by a local noble and gradually militarizing.  Thus,
    # this becomes a story of how elves learned the nature of orcs and how
    # to cope.

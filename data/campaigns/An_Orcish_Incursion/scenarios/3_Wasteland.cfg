This had been forest once, just as the one they called home. It has been murdered."

No dwarf tribe would break the ancient treaty in this way and humans weren't this... methodical and did not travel in sufficiently large numbers to the north they found to cold and damp for comfort. The big question was, would he find Rualsha here?"

    # Geographical and historical assumptions (ESR):
    # As originally written by Josh Parsons, this
    # campaign was not set in any particular time
    # or place.  I changed it to a few years after 
    # the arrival of orcs on the Great Continent, 
    # and pinned it to the northern marches of Wesmere.
    # Erlornas and his troops were professional guards,
    # but I've changed them to a scratch force of civilians 
    # raused by a local noble and gradually militarizing.
    # Thus, this becomes a story of how elves learned
    # the nature of orcs and how to cope.

	    story= _ "The arrival of humans and orcs sent shockwaves through the settled peoples of the Great Continent. Elves, dwarves, and others who had reached equilibrium with one another and become accustomed for centuries to at most small-scale clashes - little more, in truth, than armed squabbles - found themselves required to gird for warfare of unaccustomed intensity."

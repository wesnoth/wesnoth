		[part]
		story= _ "After reaching the dwarvish keep and tending to their wounded the humans led by Tallin and the dwarves led by Lord Hamel made council."
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Be welcome to the Southern Tunnels friends... or at least, what's left o' them."
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Thank you, Lord Hamel. Though Knalga lies in chaos, it is a great relief to see that at least some dwarves have survived."
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Thank you, human. It is likewise a great relief to see that our allies of old have managed to break their bonds, and live as free men once again."
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Yes, that touches on the main reason for our visit. We have broken free, but to stay free we need better weapons and armor.  Clubs and pitchforks wll not carry us through the long run."
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Dwarves are known to be the finest metalworkers and weapon-smiths. We were hoping that you would be able to help us."
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part] 

		[part]
		story= _ "Aye, our craft is great...but we dinna ha' much of weapons and armor ourselves. We're but a remnant that survived the orcs' in-taking of these caves.  There may be other remnants; but if there are, we dinna yet ken of them." 
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Some months gone we had the luck to kill the warlord who controlled the caves.  The orcs began squabbling among themselves over who would succeed him at the very moment they night ha' crushed us, else I and mine wouldna' be here to greet you."
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "We ha' been stranded in these tunnels for years now, almost completely cut off from sources of food or metals or tools.  It ha' been as much as we could do to survive.  We'll ha' more food again now that we can reach the surface, and tools aplenty there are in the stores where we couldna' reach while the orcs held them.  But metal will be scarce for a while yet; ore will have to be briught in for smelting, first."
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Is there any source of good ores nearby?"
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Aye, there is. A few miles north of here is the place where we mined many of our raw metals. However, that place also seems to be where all those skeletons are coming from. To go there would mean certain death."
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "What is the story with those skeletons anyway? They look like they were dwarves at one point but now they just attack everyone and anyone."   
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "In truth, we ha' no idea. They just started appearing one day some years after we were trapped here."
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Perhaps if we go there we can find out. Let us combine our forces and march to the mines and settle this mater once and for all." 
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]
	
		[part]
		story= _ "That way we can gather what we need to begin turning the tide against those orcs... I know it will be extremely dangerous, but it is better to die trying then to sit idle and slowly starve to death."
		background=Tallin.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "Aye, ye've the right of it, lad. Form, up men! To the mines! Let the guardsmen stay behind along with the noncombatants - for their safety and to hold the keep."
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "There are two ways we can go from here. One is through the tunnels and the other is to leave the tunnels and go through the mountains. Both ways are about the same length. If you go though the tunnels we'll be facing more trolls and perhaps skeletons. If we take the mountains - who knows. So what will it be?"
		background=Hamel.jpg
		[/part]

		[part]
		story= _ "I don't think I'm all that crazy about facing those trolls again any time soon. Let's take the mountain route."

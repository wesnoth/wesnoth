            story= _ "Soon they encountered the wrack of a great battle. Bodies of elves and orcs lay everywhere. Broken weapons and smashed armor were strewn about in profusion. Elvish arrows and orcish crossbow bolts bristled from the nearby trees. The ground was splotched red with blood."

            story= _ "Scattered around Hidel were the bodies of at least three orcish warlords, and nearly a score of grunts, warriors and crossbowmen. His weapons were notched and broken; his armor dented and smashed. It was clear to all that his fall had been an epic of valor and glory, worthy to be remembered in the songs of all the kindred races until the end of days."

            story= _ "Soon they encountered the wrack of a great battle. Bodies of elves and orcs lay everywhere. Broken weapons and smashed armor were strewn about in profusion. Elvish arrows and orcish crossbow bolts bristled from the nearby trees. The ground was splotched red with blood."

She took command of the surviving elvish forces, for all knew she was a princess of high rank and looked to Hidel's ward as their leader by right. Scarcely a face among them was less grim than her own as they took arms and started down Rakshas's back-trail."

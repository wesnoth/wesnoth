            story= _ "With Malifor’s death, the magical controls over Tallin’s will vanished. Being suddenly confronted with the reality of his actions was too much for him, and so he fled. As he did so, visions of his dying friends — friends that he had slain — flashed before his eyes, while their voices chided him from the darkness. Frantically he tried to escape their condemnation, but it seemed that at every successive turn their numbers grew greater and greater, and their words cut more and more deeply into his ravaged soul. Screaming in desperation, he called upon his arts to banish them forever into the lands of the dead, but they seemed to laugh at his attempts and rebuke him even more forcibly for his betrayal."

            story= _ "His thoughts soon turned to death as the only way to escape his punishment, and he immediately drew his dagger and plunged it into his heart. But as he stabbed himself again and again, he found that his feeble body failed to collapse, and his life force continued to dwell within his bones. Desperate, Tallin cast about for other ways of self-destruction. He soon detected the presence of a large body of water nearby, and some great monster living within its depths, and he stumbled blindly towards the oblivion offered by both."

Now I am haunted by all the evil I have done, and I see no way of escaping this torment other than self destruction."

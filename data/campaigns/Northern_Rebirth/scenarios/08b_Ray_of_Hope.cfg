            story= _ "With Malifor’s death, the magical controls over Tallin’s will vanished. Being suddenly confronted with the reality of his actions was too much for him, and so he fled. As he did so, visions of his dying friends — friends that he had slain — flashed before his eyes, while their voices chided him from the darkness. Frantically he tried to escape their condemnation, but it seemed that at every successive turn their numbers grew greater and greater, and their words cut more and more deeply into his ravaged soul. Screaming in desperation, he called upon his arts to banish them forever into the lands of the dead, but they seemed to laugh at his attempts and rebuke him even more forcibly for his betrayal."

            story= _ "His thoughts soon turned to death as the only way to escape his punishment, and he immediately drew his dagger and plunged it into his heart. But as he stabbed himself again and again, he found that his feeble body failed to collapse, and his life force continued to dwell within his bones. Desperate, Tallin cast about for other ways of self-destruction. He soon detected the presence of a large body of water nearby, and some great monster living within its depths, and he stumbled blindly towards the oblivion offered by both."

While under his control, I have done unthinkable deeds — I have studied the most forbidden of arts, I have robbed the dead of their rest, and I have mercilessly butchered my friends like some sort of mindless abomination. Now I am haunted by all the evil I have done, and I see no way of escaping this torment other then self destruction."

They trusted me to always be there with them, guiding and leading them, and putting myself in the forefront of every battle. If I were not there they never would have risked their lives — nay, if I were not there they wouldn’t be dead right now! And I betrayed them! Those who trusted me most I slew with my own hands!"

It was Malifor who had bound you to his will, and thus the blame of all your crimes falls on him. Now that he is dead, you are free, both of his will, and of the crimes he has committed through you."

Your words, although kind, are not enough to relieve me of my guilt."

For hundreds of years now, it passed from king to successor. Ever since it has been wielded by men, the ruling class never became corrupt, the people never lacked justice and neither evil nor wars ever troubled the land."

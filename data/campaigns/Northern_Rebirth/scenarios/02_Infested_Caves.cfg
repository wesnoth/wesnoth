            story= _ "Ill-armed and untrained though they were, the people of Dwarven Doors rose against the Orcs. Although their losses had been tremendous, never once did they break or falter. In the end, the orcish host was smashed and the survivors sent scurrying for their lives."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "Grief for the fallen could not suppress the people’s joy in their newfound freedom. They ransacked the orcish storehouses, sang, danced and drank with abandon. New-fledged warriors boasted of their deeds in the battle, while the women and children looked on with awe."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "Amidst all the revelry, Tallin alone remained grave. He knew it likely that the orcs would return with a vengeance and slaughter every last one of them. The following morning, he gathered the cooler heads about him so they could set their next course. How might they, untrained in the art of war and without expectation of aid from the prosperous human lands of the south, defend themselves?"
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "The war council’s thoughts quickly turned to the dwarves, close allies in the past. However, nobody knew the state of things in the Knalgan tunnels. The bravest of scouts found in there the spoor of many trolls, and of creatures darker than trolls. It was even rumored that the dwarven dead from the invasion of Knalga had risen in unlife, roaming the tunnels to slay the living. Fighting through all manner of unknown monsters in the mere hope of finding surviving dwarves held but little appeal."

            # wmllint: local spelling woodsrunners
            story= _ "So the matter lay, and the peasants dithered from one suggested plan of action to the next, never arriving at any conclusion. In the meantime, some help, unlooked for, arrived in the form of a small band of woodsrunners — escapees from the orcs, grown wood-wise and crafty, and in contact with larger bands of poachers and outlaws roaming the night. Embassies were sent; agreements made. A handful of experienced fighters, scarred and closemouthed, came to Dwarven Doors to find and train the most willing in their rugged fighting style."
        [/part]
        [part]
            # wmllint: local spelling nightrunners
            story= _ "A fortnight after their victory, the town was awakened from slumber in the dead of night by the distant booming of orcish drums. Scouts training with the nightrunners returned to cry the news that a strong orcish company was approaching. Frightened as they had never been before, the folk of Dwarven Doors looked to Tallin for guidance."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story= _ "Faced with certain destruction at the hands of the orcs, or a fate unknown in the caves of Knalga, Tallin chose the latter. The people quickly gathered together and collected whatever food and weapons they could and plunged into the darkness of the caves."

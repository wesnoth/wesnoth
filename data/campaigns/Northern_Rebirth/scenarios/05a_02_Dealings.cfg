All of them were manned by alert and well-armed dwarves who hailed them boisterously. Smoke belched from furiously working forges and the heat from the smelters was nearly staggering. New weapons and armor for humans and dwarves alike lay neatly stacked, and the deafening clang of hammers and picks from the dwarves promised more."

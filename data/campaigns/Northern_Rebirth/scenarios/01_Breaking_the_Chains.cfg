            story= _ "Far to the north of Wesnoth, and hard by the dwarven caves of Knalga, there was once a thriving mixed community known as Dwarven Doors. Food, wood, and cloth from all over Wesnoth and many elvish lands as well were brought here to be sold to the dwarves, while ores, metals and worked dwarven manufactures were bought here to be traded throughout the surface nations. Dwarves and humans worked and lived side by side; even the elves who came to trade mingled more with the other kindred races than was common elsewhere. Dwarven Doors grew populous and wealthy."

            story= _ "The dwarves of Knalga, cannily reckoning the gains from trade, built strong fortifications around Dwarven Doors. The people who called it home, dwarven and human alike, knew that the wealth of their city might arouse envy from afar — hence they kept their weapons sharp, and reckoned themselves well able to fight off any bandit gang or petty warlord that could arise in the thinly-settled northlands."

Then there arose a great warlord among the Bloody Sword tribe, the chieftain called Khazg Black-Tusk; and he raised an army, and besieged Dwarven Doors."

            story= _ "It was a time of doom and great deeds, of fire and blood and slaughter. The men and dwarves of the city fought valiantly. But there were always, it seemed, more orcs to replace the slain, while the defenders could find no succor. Pleas for help went unheeded in other lands, for they were far away and felt unthreatened by the orcs, and were wrapped up in their own affairs and struggles."

The dwarves were pushed back into the caverns of Knalga, while the humans of Dwarven Doors who survived the sack were enslaved by the orcs. Cut off from contact with the surface, the dwarves of Knalga fought on, but knew their utter subjugation could not be averted forever."

All at once, the war-drums of the orcs began pounding; harsh war-cries sounded as orcs mustered to gather their weapons and man their posts. Startled, the peasants looked around in alarm, and that was when they saw him."

To his right fought an elderly mage whose deep voice boomed incantations over the clamor of the battle while the very earth shook with the power of his spells. To his left, glowing with faerie fire, was a great lord of the elves. They were followed closely and supported by a small but powerful elvish army."

His father was a weaponsmith, his family used less brutally than most because the orcish masters put more value on that craft. In secret, his mother even taught him letters. As the boy grew to young manhood, he could touch blades, and dream. And he did."

He fled to an abandoned ruin in the forest to rally his fellow peasants."

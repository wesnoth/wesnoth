        [part]
            story= _ "It was fierce and bloody. We fought them for three days and nights with no end in sight. Every time we killed an orc, it seemed that two more would take his place. We most assuredly cannot win fighting like this."

        [/part]

        [part]
            story= _ "So you withdrew. Rightly done, me lad. Our prepared defenses will be able to hold the orcs off far longer and with less loss then ye could ha' done in the open field. I see that my training of you hasna' been for naught."

        [part]
            story= _ "That will be very difficult. We did that last time and they will no doubt be alert to that threat now. Anyway, it would be but temporary solution. Soon another strong leader would emerge and we'd find oursel' back in the same coil."

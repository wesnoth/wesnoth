        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "It was fierce and bloody. We fought them for three days and nights with no end in sight. Every time we killed an orc, it seemed that two more would take his place. We most assuredly cannot win fighting like this.")}

        {STORY_PART_HAMEL (_ "So you withdrew. Rightly done, me lad. Our prepared defenses will be able to hold the orcs off far longer and with less loss than ye could ha’ done in the open field. I see that my training of you hasna’ been for naught.")}

        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "And I am grateful — but what should we do from here? The number of humans and dwarves is limited, unlike the orcs whose numbers seem unlimited.")}

        {STORY_PART_HAMEL (_ "Aye. But we must utterly crush this orcish host if we are to ha’ anything other than a brief respite.")}

        {STORY_PART_HAMEL (_ "Orcs are fickle; if we negotiated a treaty with them — assuming they would accept — it would just be broken as soon as the next warlord arose among them.")}

        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "Then what shall we do? Can we assassinate this Rakshas fellow and throw them into disarray once more?")}

        #po: "coil" meant, in Middle and Early Modern English, a difficulty
        #po: or problem.
        {STORY_PART_HAMEL (_ "That will be very difficult. We did that last time and they will no doubt be alert to that threat now. Anyway, it would be but a temporary solution. Soon another strong leader would emerge and we’d find oursel’ back in the same coil.")}

        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "Well, back to the drawing board. What should we do?")}

        {STORY_PART_HAMEL (_ "I think we should try to gather more allies. That way we can engage them on many fronts, or divide them into smaller groups, or cut them off from their supplies. The possibilities are endless.")}

        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "Wise words, but who is there in these wild Northlands that might aid us?")}

        {STORY_PART_HAMEL (_ "You can count the Elves out. They are a selfish lot, only interested in themselves. They would only aid us if something drastic happened to them and they needed our help. What about Wesnoth?")}

        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "Wesnoth is too far away, and we have no idea what political state they are in.")}

        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "The last news we heard of them was years ago when Prince Konrad passed through here. At that time the evil queen Asheviere was ruling, and it was said that she was in alliance with the orcs.")}

        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "And then that Princess Li’sar was in hot pursuit of Konrad as well. I wonder what became of them.")}

        {STORY_PART_HAMEL (_ "The last time any dwarf set eyes on Konrad was when he set out to the eastern tunnels in search of the Sceptre of Fire, so he could claim his place as ruler.")}

        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "Geez, what a fool’s quest. Everyone in these Northlands knows that the Sceptre is long gone.")}

        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "But we’re meandering. Where can we find allies in these wild Northlands?")}

        {STORY_PART_FATHER_MORVIN (_ "Tallin, before I was captured by Malifor, I used to be in contact with a powerful magician called Ro’Arthian and his brother Ro’Sothian.")}

        {STORY_PART_HAMEL (_ "Ro’Arthian, bah! Don’t utter that cursed name!")}

        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "Why not, Hamel, have you a grievance with him?")}

        {STORY_PART_HAMEL (_ "I have heard all about him from my good friend Stalrag. He is — or was anyway, haven’t heard from him in years — the chief o’ the villages that lay along Highbrook Pass.")}

        {STORY_PART_HAMEL (_ "Those foul mages have long terrorized Stalrag and his people.")}

        {STORY_PART_FATHER_MORVIN (_ "Remember, Hamel, there are often two sides to a story like this. Perhaps the mages see your dwarves as invaders. How would you feel if say... the elves decided to come in and level Knalga so they can grow another big forest on top?")}

        {STORY_PART_HAMEL (_ "Those filthy elves! I’ll...")}

        {STORY_PART_FATHER_MORVIN (_ "See?")}

        {STORY_PART_HAMEL (_ "What were you doing keeping contact with mages such as those anyway? Trying to save their souls?")}

        {STORY_PART_SISTER_THERA (_ "(<i>Giggle</i>) Something like that.")}

        {STORY_PART_FATHER_MORVIN (_ "(<i>Rolls eyes</i>)")}

        {STORY_PART_HAMEL (_ "Father Morvin, what are you trying to say?")}

        {STORY_PART_FATHER_MORVIN (_ "I propose that we go to Highbrook Pass and see how matters stand for ourselves. If the wizards are still alive, we might be able to persuade them to help us. What’s more, if Stalrag is still around we could use his help too.")}

        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "I don’t see how just two mages could help us very much, Father.")}

        {STORY_PART_FATHER_MORVIN (_ "They are not just any two mages. They have fine control over many creatures of the wild such as ogres, gryphons, and sometimes even trolls! It would be no bad thing to have those on your side for once.")}

        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "That sounds really good. What do you think, Hamel?")}

        # wmllint: local spelling hrmph
        {STORY_PART_HAMEL (_ "Hrmph. These are desperate times. If those lunatics of mages will agree to help, I guess we’ll nae have any other choice but to accept.")}

        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "Hey, we have had experiences with crazy mages ourselves. Believe me, they are dangerous! You will feel a lot better with some of them on your side.")}

        {STORY_PART_HAMEL (_ "Ye’ll need to travel light to reach Highbrook Pass before the orcs mount another assault in force. I think ye should take as little gold as you think ye’ll need and leave the rest here. We’ll store it in the tunnels furthest away from the attacking orcs in case they break through.")}

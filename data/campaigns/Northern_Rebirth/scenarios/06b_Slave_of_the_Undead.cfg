Instead of just giving up as they should, they keep foolishly attempting to attack me time and again. This time they have attacked and seized one of the northern entrances. Although I can easily defeat them as I have done several times when you were in training, this time I want you to take care of them in a more... final way. Consider it a test of your loyalty."

But the magical control that Malifor had over him was so great that he had no choice but to obey his master. Thus, with his own will madly struggling to break free of the lich, Tallin made his way to the northern entrance."

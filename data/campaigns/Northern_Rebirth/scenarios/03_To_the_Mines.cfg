You see, lad, in these caves there is no more fearsome a foe then a dwarf. Not only do we move through the caves swiftly, but we know them like the backs of our hands. The orcs did indeed manage to swamp our defenses with their sheer numbers all those long years ago, but not before we surprised and slew their leader — the cursed Khazg Black-Tusk. Since then, although the orcs still foul these caves with their stench, their attacks have been uncoordinated and erratic, wi’ the orcs as likely to attack each other as they are to attack us."

They just started appearing one day some years after we were trapped here — by ones and twos in the beginning, and now by the hordes. We were fair frightened when we first encountered them, but we soon discovered they fell to our hammers just as readily as the orcs fell to our axes. So, it is not their existence I fear — for we have faced far worse trials — but their rising numbers gives cause for worry..."

It ha’ been as much as we could do to survive. We’ll get more food again now that we can reach the surface, and tools aplenty there are in the stores where we couldna’ reach while the orcs and trolls held them. But metal will be scarce for a while yet; ore will have to be brought in for smelting, first."

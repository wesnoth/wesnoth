            story= _ "One day a gryphon came screeching into the caves with the news that a large elvish force approached from the east. Messages were quickly dispatched to the elves asking their purpose. The haughty reply was that their purpose was none of any dwarf’s or human’s business, and that all would be well-advised to stay in their holes when the elves passed near."

            story= _ "Before the humans and dwarves could respond to this message, another gryphon arrived with the news that the orcs were holding an elvish sorceress prisoner in the castle of Bitterhold, less than a day’s march distant to the northwest. The castle had attracted notice because it had been recently rebuilt and manned by a unit known to include some of the hardiest and toughest of veteran orcs."

            story= _ "Gryphons and a picked force of human woodsmen were sent out that very night, and less than two days later managed to ambush an orcish messenger on the road out of Bitterhold. The messenger was carrying a ransom demand to the elves — for the sorceress was, in fact, a princess of the highest rank."

        {STORY_PART_HAMEL (_ "Allies? I take it we’re to go to them and ask them to join us in return for our help in rescuing their Princess? You heard their message — those elves have got their noses so high in the air they canna’ see over them. They wouldna’ ally themselves with the likes o’ us.")}

        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "Of course we won’t do that. As a matter of fact I think it’s best that we don’t say anything to the elves at all.")}

        {STORY_PART_STALRAG (_ "Why d’ye say that?")}

        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "Well, suppose we do join up with the elves — assuming they will let us — and we make a combined raid on the fortress, what will the orcs most likely do when the ransom slips from their grasp?")}

        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "Exactly. On the other hand, if we raided the fortress while the orcs were talking ransom with the elves, the orcs might hesitate just long enough.")}

        {STORY_PART_HAMEL (_ "Hmmm... I think you’ve the right of it, lad. Most orcs being thicker than a wood-knot, I’d lay odds on Rakshas giving strict orders that she not be touched without his direct word on the matter.")}

        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "But it would be unwise to trust that the orcs will stay stupid forever. If we do go ahead with this raid, we are going to have to be in and out like lightning.")}

        {STORY_PART_STALRAG (_ "My Shinsplitters will be invaluable for a job like this. They are fierce and never give ground and will not stop attacking until either they or their opponent lies dead. No fortress can stand long against them.")}

        {STORY_PART_SISTER_THERA (_ "Elves are deeply honor-bound, especially in matters that touch their kin. If we rescue the princess, I am certain the deed will not go without reward.")}

        {STORY_PART_TALLIN (_ "And at the very least, the orcs will not be able to raise troops with ransom money they don’t have.")}

        {STORY_PART_ARTHIAN (_ "Bah... weak, soft humans. Have it your way if you must.")}

        {STORY_PART_HAMEL (_ "So it shall be, Tallin, I’ll hold the caves here while you and Stalrag’s Shinsplitters fare to Bitterhold. The orcs still haven’t given up their attack on our southern tunnels.")}

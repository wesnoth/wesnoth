            story= _ "One day a gryphon came screeching into the caves with the news that a large elvish force approached from the east. Messages were quickly dispatched to the elves asking their purpose. The haughty reply was that their purpose was none of any dwarf's or human's business, and that all would be well-advised to stay in their holes when the elves passed near."
        [/part]

        [part]
            story= _ "Before the humans and dwarves could respond to this message, another gryphon arrived with the news that the orcs were holding an elvish sorceress prisoner in the castle of Bitterhold, less than a day's march distant to the northwest. The castle had attracted notice because it had been recently rebuilt and manned by a unit known to include some of the hardiest and toughest of veteran orcs."

        [part]
            story= _ "Gryphons and a picked force of human woodsmen were sent out that very night, and less than two days later managed to ambush an orcish messenger on the road out of Bitterhold. The messenger was carrying a ransom demand to the elves - for the sorceress was, in fact, a princess of the highest rank."

        [part]
            story=  _ "Hmmm...I think you've the right of it, lad. Most orcs being thicker than a wood-knot, I'd lay odds on Rakshas giving strict orders that she not be touched without his direct word on the matter."

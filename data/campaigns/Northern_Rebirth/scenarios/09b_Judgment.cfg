            story= _ "Driven by an overwhelming need to be released from his torment, Tallin approached the Rod of Justice where it lay amidst the Dragon’s hoarded treasure. But as he was about to grasp it in his trembling hands, he hesitated and found himself unable to proceed. Abhai came forth — his ethereal form gliding over the scattered treasure and the carcases of its defenders — and fearlessly lifted the Rod in his ghostly hands. He paused for a moment, as if savoring the familiar feel of it in his grasp once more, and then presented it to Tallin."

            story= _ "Tallin raised his eyes to look into Abhai’s and Abhai met his gaze — confidence meeting uncertainty, faith meeting doubt, assurance meeting apprehension. <i>“I have faith in you, my boy,”</i> Abhai said, <i>“Take this, and put your doubts at rest.”</i> Tallin held the gaze for one more long moment — and then took the Rod of Justice in a white-knuckled grip."

            story= _ "Searing pain flooded through him. A light, not bright and not dark, but tremendously powerful, blinded him through his clenched eyelids. As his minions stared blankly, his entire being erupted in ethereal fire and his physical form crumpled to the cavern floor."

            story=_ "Delfador returned to Weldyn, but not before secreting the Book of Crelanu in a place known only to him. To his surprise, Asheviere made no further mention of the events in the manor. But not long after, orcish raids increased to a degree that threatened the Kingdom. The King mustered his armies to deal with the orcish menace, leading to the great battle at the Ford of Abez that was lost through betrayal."

            story=_"Delfadorâ€™s last great quest, after that battle, is described in the tale called <i>Heir to the Throne</i>. In it is told how he ended the usurpation of Asheviere and restored the rightful heir to the throne of Wesnoth."

        [part]
            story=_ "After restoring the rightful heir to the throne of Wesnoth, Delfador lived the rest of his life as an advisor to the new rulers. He devoted much of his attention to restoring the Great Academy in Alduin to its former glory. But his efforts there were to bear little fruit in his lifetime; for through many years of war and strife, very few mages were left, and none of them came near in power and skill to Delfador, greatest mage ever to grace the courts of Wesnoth."

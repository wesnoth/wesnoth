            story=_"Kalenz and Chantal and their troops departed to ride against the remnants of the orcish Great Horde. Delfador returned to Weldyn with the King and his gift from the elves, the Book of Crelanu. However, despite the victory, Delfador was deeply worried by the undead menace. On the way back they met with Lionel who was arriving with reinforcements, and were deeply saddened to learn that Leollyn had died under very suspicious circumstances."

We have assembled here with good and bad news: The good news is that the orcs have been defeated decisively. Their Great Chief is dead and their army has been scattered. We owe much of this great victory to Delfador."

I did very little, sire. It was actually the elves who saved us on that day."

Peace, Lionel. The elves fought well and have earned Our respect. But this council is here to address an alarming matter. Young master Delfador here reports of an undead threat. He was able to fight them off at Parthyn Ford, but more are coming."

Your majesty, these are  no stray undead; This  lunatic, Iliah-Malal, has opened a portal to the Land of the Dead. Unless we close this portal soon,  the relatively small numbers of enemy troops he now commands will swell into an endless steam of undead. And our army, having equipped and trained primarily to fight raiding orcs, is not well suited to fight even the forces he fields now. Mages, in combination with heavy infantry are most effective against them."

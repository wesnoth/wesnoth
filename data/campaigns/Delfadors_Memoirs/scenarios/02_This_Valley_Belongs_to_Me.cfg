            story = _ "But the elder mage’s health was taxed by the rigors of the journey. A year after the two left Alduin, Methor settled in a tranquil valley at the edge of the Dulatus Hills, not far southeast of the capitol at Weldyn. He opened a small school of his own, and with Delfador assisting him he began training a handful of youths who might in time be worthy to enter the great Academy on Alduin."

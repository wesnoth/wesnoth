            story=_"While Delfador was still at the Academy, major events were taking place throughout Wesnoth. After centuries of squabbling, a warlord emerged to unite the orcs. This was ill tidings for humans and elves alike."

            #po: "errantry" is an archaic English word associated with medieval
            #po: knights. It means he wandered around looking for monsters to
            #po: slay and wrongs to right.
            story=_"There was an elf named Kalenz who had already in Delfadorâ€™s time been a legend among his people for centuries; his tale, <i>The Legend of Wesmere</i>, is known throughout the elven lands. Prolonged in life by a necromantic potion, he put aside the High Lordship of the Elves after the death of his beloved wife, and wandered the Great Continent in errantry."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story=_"But Kalenz half-knew and half-feared he would be needed again, and the day he had long foreseen finally arrived. Report came to him of large orcish forces attacking the outskirts of elvish forests, including Lintanir itself. Kalenz quickly gathered a small troop of picked guards. War had returned to the land of the elves."

            story=_ "Upon his return to Weldyn, Delfador discovered that the queen had left with a strong escort to visit her family’s demesne and her ailing parents. Lionel, the King’s most trusted general, had been sent at Asheviere’s request on an errand to Knalga to retrieve the Sceptre of Fire. That mission would cost Lionel his life; and neither Lionel nor Delfador knew that Lionel’s mission had been compromised from the start."

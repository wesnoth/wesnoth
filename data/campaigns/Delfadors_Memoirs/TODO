ShadowMaster's review
---------------------
02:23 <Shadow_Master> scenario 4, "lleollyn" doesn't use deciduous forests
02:24 <Shadow_Master> the first scenario in the swamps (with the rogues) is as visually uninteresting as usual
02:25 <Shadow_Master> Ur-Thorodor's portrait is still blocky (enclosed by a black background, all in a 205x205 square)
02:27 <Shadow_Master> LOL there's still a debug "moveto event" on the first "land of the dead" scenario?!
02:28 <Shadow_Master> Terror at Parthyn's map is visually uninteresting due to the large grassland areas
02:29 <Shadow_Master> "Return of Trouble" has perhaps too many villages. I wonder if it's even balanced.
02:29 <Shadow_Master> Chantal does a funny MUF at the end of Return of Trouble
02:30 <Shadow_Master> Shadows in the Dark is still visually uninteresting
02:30 <Shadow_Master> I wonder if the Holy Water flask *on the water* (19,11 on Shadows in the Dark) is deliberate
02:31 <Shadow_Master> "Save the King" is not very asthethically pleasing.
02:32 <Shadow_Master> but perhaps esr couldn't think of a way to make it look better in such a small area (harhar)
02:32 <Shadow_Master> I hate large areas of flat grassland
02:33 <Shadow_Master> two consecutive storyscreen scenarios afterwards. suspicious.
02:33 <Shadow_Master> A New Ally: why only pine trees?
02:33 <Shadow_Master> the usage of deep water there is more innovative tho
02:34 <Shadow_Master> A New Ally: old crappy desert mountains in middle of regular mountains. And the map borders are incomplete. *sigh*
02:34 <Shadow_Master> Same scenario: I start to think Delfador should be nicknamed "the Messiah" ;)
02:37 <Shadow_Master> the scenario prior to "showdown in the northern swamp" is more asthetically pleasing.
02:37 <Shadow_Master> "Showdown in the...": I hate scenarios in which units talk to other units under shroud.
02:39 <Shadow_Master> it's not an asethetically pleasing one, and the southern border of the river ends rather abruptily. Awkward?
02:40 <Shadow_Master> "Prince of Wesnoth": oh my ******g god, another scenario in which units speak under fog/shroud. But I guess this is a way to remind people that Wesnoth Is Not Realistic, huh?
02:40 <Shadow_Master> there is a huge area of plain grassland there too
02:40 <Shadow_Master> *huge areas.
02:41 <Shadow_Master> of course, there are human villages to break the monotony a bit. a bit.
02:41 <Shadow_Master> only a bit
02:41 <Shadow_Master> Clash at the Manor: ludicrous abuse of Great Trees(tm)
02:42 <Shadow_Master> Face of the Enemy: apparently i'm the only one who can design non-monotonous Enemy Lairs(tm)
02:42 <Shadow_Master> (i.e. FotE is monotonous. Not unlike DiD's "Alone at Last" series, anyway)
02:43 <Shadow_Master> esr, fabi this is the end of my first-glance review. Take it or love it.
02:43 <Shadow_Master> and I'm being serious.
02:45 <fabi> Shadow_Master: Thank you

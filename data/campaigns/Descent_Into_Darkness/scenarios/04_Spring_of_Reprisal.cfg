            story= _ "Weeks pass in the cold, bare caverns. As the grip of black magic grows stronger, so does Malin’s control of the undead. He finds it to be a mastery of a different sort than what he was taught at the Academy. The magic reaches out to him as it never has before; he listens and it speaks back — he senses its will and lets it guide him — he embraces the dark magic as an extension of himself."

            story= _ "When spring comes, Darken Volk leads Malin toward the jagged mountain peaks in the north. In the higher reaches, snow begins to melt into rivulets of water, streaming downward and fracturing the surface of the ice that blankets the river Listra. Though the unstable terrain is hazardous to traverse, the elder necromancer insists that they press on, saying that he hopes to catch the orcish fighters unprepared by arriving early in the year."

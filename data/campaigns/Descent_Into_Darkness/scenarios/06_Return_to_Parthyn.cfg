He follows them down the western bank of the river Listra, past the Whitefang Mountains. He wonders why they continue rushing toward the Great River instead of calling for reinforcements, but after a bit of thought, he realizes where the orcs are headed. It is, after all, the season when they usually raid human towns."

I suppose he must think that I intend to attack the rest of the Whitefangs rather than pursue him this far; with his brethren occupied against me, he will be able to raid more human towns undisturbed. Selfish creature. Exactly what one would expect from an orc.’</i> Malin thinks carefully and quickly realizes what he should do."

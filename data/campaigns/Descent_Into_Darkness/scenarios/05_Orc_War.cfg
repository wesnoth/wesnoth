            story=_ "All through the summer and fall, the necromancer and his apprentice travel through orc-held lands. At night, they cause skeletons and ghosts to emerge from the forests to terrorize and kill entire camps of orcs and their goblin minions. Word spreads among the orcish towns, which begin to post guards and leave torches burning all night. These measures do little to help them."

            story=_ "Word spreads to the south as well, of the many battles won against the orc tribes, as Darken Volk tells Malin. As spring rolls around, a number of dark adepts, eager to aid in the fight, travel northwards and join the pair. <i>“They are quite useful in battle,”</i> the necromancer says to Malin, <i>“but none of them have even a tenth of your potential power.”</i>"

Eventually, at a narrow place in the river men call the Longlier and Elves call the Arkan-thoria, they manage to surround the humans and force a fight."

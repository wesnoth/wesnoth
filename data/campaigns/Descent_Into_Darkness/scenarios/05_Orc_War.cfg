            story=_ "The cycle of the seasons churns and summer and fall roll around once more. Malin’s thoughts turn back to Parthyn frequently, where a year prior, he had still been among family and friends in the rustic little town that he still thinks of as his home. He has since become a forsaken wanderer, he thinks, but the still burning image of his father being cut down amidst the ruins of his home is imprinted at the forefront of his mind."

            story=_ "Companionship and peace... perhaps they are but a farce and certainly an impossibility with the threat of the orcish clans still looming. Perhaps there is no point in reminiscing on his once peaceful, pastoral life. He has never been one for regrets."

            story=_ "Malin turns his attention to the task at hand. Darken Volk leads him through the heart of the Whitefang territory, where they terrorize and murder entire camps of orcs with their undead minions. Word spreads among the orcish towns, which begin to post more guards and dispatch frequent patrols to exterminate the two necromancers. All of their attempts fail."

            story=_ "Word spreads to the south as well when the ever present raids are suddenly absent this year. The people at the frontier towns go about their days, gossiping about rumors of the undead, some with disgust, some with intrigue. When winter passes and spring comes again, a number of dark adepts travel northward and join the pair of necromancers. <i>“They can be quite useful,”</i> Darken Volk says to Malin, <i>“but none of them have even a tenth of your potential power.”</i>"

The orcs pursue the two necromancers east toward the mouth of the river Men call the Longlier and Elves call the Arkan-thoria, where they manage to surround the humans and force a fight."

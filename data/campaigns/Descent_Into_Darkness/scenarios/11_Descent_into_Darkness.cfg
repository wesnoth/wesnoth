    # This is a 3 part scenario that goes as follows (SPOILERS HERE)
    # Part 1 - Malin completes the ritual that is his declension into lichdom
    #       Gameplay - fight against ghouls+corpses, skeletons, then ghosts in that order
    #       Stand on runes that will give you buffs that help you beat the ritual
    # Part 2 - explore the new lair and complete some puzzles
    #       Puzzles give some small dmg bonuses
    #       You can regain health and get some exp from creeps, but be wary of the giant spider lurking somewhere
    # Part 3 - Boss battle with fire dragon
    #       Fight against respawning fire elementals, step onto runes to gain some free units (differs depending on rune)
    #       You get 3 ghost-type units (from recall list) that will help you
    #       When you defeat the dragon, you will get a special skeletal dragon with feeding

The necromancer must make the necessary incantations with his dying breaths, then conquer his own spirit much the same way he binds the spirits of others. Because he retains his own will, however, the lich can call upon the awesome powers of the spirit world.”</i>"

As he sees the number of orcs, he begins to realize the futility of his quest — harassing and harrying one clan of orcs is a far different task than waging a truly meaningful war against them as a whole. Then again, perhaps he is beyond the point of ordinary reason."

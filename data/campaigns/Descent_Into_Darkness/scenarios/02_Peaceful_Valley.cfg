He curses the elder mages for sending him from the Isle of Alduin half-prepared, only to be thrust into conflict. He curses Drogan for lacking the courage to see what must be done. Most fiercely, he curses the orcs for ravaging his family and home through their ceaseless attacks."

The necromancer takes pity on Malin in his friendless state, and asks Malin to travel with him. As the weeks pass, he teaches Malin more dark magic."

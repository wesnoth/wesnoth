    # this is a proper battle scenario really focused on armies for once, so this one doesn't have any really special events; it's nice to have just this one vanilla scenario in the campaign
    # there's also a lot less dialogue here intentionally because Malin's focused on fighting off the orcs
    # when he does kill a chieftain, he doesn't give them time to speak (it's a tough battle, he doesn't spare the time or the energy to deal with them)
    # noting that it's a tough battle, the scenario should be appropriately difficult

            story=_ "The cycle of the seasons churns and summer and fall roll around once more. Malin’s thoughts turn back to Parthyn frequently, where a year prior, he had still been among family and friends in the rustic little town that he still thinks of as his home. He has since become a forsaken wanderer, he thinks, but the still burning image of his father being cut down amidst the ruins of his home is stamped deep into his thoughts."

            story=_ "Companionship and peace... perhaps they are but a farce and certainly an impossibility with the threat of the orcish clans still looming. It was a choice to live and suffer the path of solitary vengeance rather than appease the law of his land... and thus watch his home burn. It was a choice, he admits, not destiny, not fate. It is a choice that he oft ponders, but usually comes to the same conclusion. Perhaps there is no point in reminiscing on his once tranquil, pastoral life. He has never been one for regrets."

            story=_ "Malin turns his attention to the task at hand. Darken Volk leads him through the heart of the Whitefang territory, where they terrorize and murder entire camps of orcs with their undead minions. Word spreads among the orcish towns, which begin to post more guards and dispatch frequent patrols to exterminate the two necromancers. All of their attempts fail."

The orcs pursue the two necromancers east toward the mouth of the river Men call the Longlier and Elves call the Arkan-thoria, where they manage to surround the humans and force a fight."

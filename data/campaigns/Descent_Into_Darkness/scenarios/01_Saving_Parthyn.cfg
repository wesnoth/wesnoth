            # po: comments about dialogue style and characterization **THIS TEXT CONTAINS SPOILERS**:
            # po:
            # po: Drogan: although he is the captain of Parthyn's guard, he shows signs of recklessness and inflexibility; he's stiff and stubborn, which causes him to butt heads with Malin
            # po:           often, we see that Drogan says something to Malin (e.g. banishing him) without a clearly good reason why, and that's because of his ego and confidence in his own righteousness
            # po:           Drogan speaks with a country accent, using things like "ta" instead of "to", "ya" instead of "you", "thar" instead of "there", and some incorrect grammatical constructs like "them orcs" instead of "the orcs"
            # po: Darken Volk: he talks a little more formally than Malin, and has quite a few ellipses in his speech. These are at points where he's not speaking exactly what he's thinking in his head because in reality,
            # po:           he's trying to manipulate Malin for his own gain. His mode of speech is a little more formal.
            # po: Dela: little more of a minor character, she's what you might expect from a sister. She isn't wholly against Malin until he kills Drogan, but she also doesn't really want to do much with a necromancer either.
            # po:           She tries to be understanding, but falls short in the end because of her prejudice against dark magic. Note: Dela also speaks with a country accent like Drogan, but not as heavily so.
            # po:           More "country accent" words: "s'ppose" instead of suppose, "’em" instead of them, dropping the g at the end of a word for ’ (bickering -> bickerin’), "’bout" instead of "about", "’im" instead of him
            # po:           "woulda" -> would have, "o’" -> of, "gotta" -> have to
            # po: Malin: rash and impulsive, he cares a lot about his home, but doesn't see that power itself can be a corrupting force (though he does not seek power just for the sake of it, it is for another purpose which is
            # po:           to drive off the orcs). He's a little more informal in his speech, meaning more contractions and colloquialisms, stemming from his "country accent" (which is not as strong as Drogan's or Dela's due to his time on Alduin).
            # po: Things to be careful about while editing: there are some poems in S8 and S11, please be mindful when making wording changes there. Some commas are added for readability even though they may not be grammatically correct.
            # po:
            # po: If the target language has a specialized term for a fortified town, like Latin "oppidum", use it for Parthyn.
            story= _ "Malin Keshar was born ten years after the death of Haldric IV. He grew up in the northern border town of Parthyn, the second child and eldest son of the city’s baron. Every summer, by the time the mountainous paths and high passes shed their wintry gowns of snow, orcs descended from the northern hills to ravage the settlements at the frontier. Every year, Malin’s father led the townsfolk to repel the raids and force the orcs to retreat back to the north."

            story= _ "When Malin was ten, a passing mage sensed strong magical abilities in the boy and suggested he be sent to the Isle of Alduin for training in the magical arts. Malin studied there for eight years, learning all manner of magic from basic control over the elements, to the mystic arts and scrying, to alchemy and simple medicine."

        [part]
            story= _ "Although his life on Alduin was luxurious and peaceful, Malin found the teachings of the scholarly mages to be too philosophical for his tastes. His thoughts turned back to Parthyn, where more practical magics were necessary to drive off the orcs. Malin began to research these magics on his own, but his lack of patience and general indiscresion eventually led to several confrontations with his teachers and other students. Believing Malin to be too reckless, the mages expelled him from Alduin."

            story= _ "When Malin returned to Parthyn, orcs had already begun to attack the city. Although he tried his best to fight them off, the raids were far more relentless and the town guard was far weaker than he had remembered. One night, a particularly powerful band of orcs overran the city walls and Malin could only watch as his father was cut down by one of the savage orcish warriors."

            story= _ "Shaken by the loss of their commander, the human defense began to falter. The orcs roared in anticipation of victory, but before they could overrun the city, skeleton warriors poured out of the woods to their rear. The undead cut down orc after orc, swords and axes hacking through flesh and bone with ruthless efficiency. The soldiers watched in half amazement, half fear as the orcs dropped and the skeletons turned toward them, empty eyes bleeding with fetid magic. All was dreadfully still as the blood and carnage settled in the rank darkness."

While I know you do not love my kind, I think it is vital that we put aside our differences. The orcish menace grows in the north and they will soon return in even greater force. You cannot hope to defend against them without my... help. For now, I ask only to refresh myself in your town.”</i>"

            story= _ "Drogan, the captain of the guard, replied, <i>“Nay, ye surely know that tha law says tha penalty fer necromancy be death. But, since you’ve saved our town, I’ll let ya rest here fer up ta three days. After, I’m banishin’ ya from Parthyn. Should ye return, we’ll attack ya on sight.”</i>"

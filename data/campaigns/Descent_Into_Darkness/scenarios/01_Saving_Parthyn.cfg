            story= _ "Malin Keshar was born ten years after the death of Haldric IV. He grew up in the northern border town of Parthyn, the second child and eldest son of the baron of the city. Every summer when the mountain passes became clear, orcs came down from the north to prove themselves in battle. Every year Parthyn’s guards repelled the raids, though some of the townsfolk were always lost. Malin’s father led raiding parties to disrupt the orc encampments and send the orcs back to the north."

            story= _ "When Malin was 10, a mage who passed through the town sensed strong magical abilities in the boy. His parents, seeing a chance for him to live away from the constant battles with the orcs, arranged for him to be sent to the mage community on the Isle of Alduin. There he studied for eight years, while back at home the orc raids increased in their frequency and ferocity. Before Malin could finish his training, however, he was expelled."

As the orcs roared in anticipation of victory, skeleton warriors poured out of the woods to the orcs’ rear. The soldiers watched in amazement as the skeletons cut down orc after orc and then melted back into the forest."

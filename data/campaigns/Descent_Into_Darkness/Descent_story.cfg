    [story]
        [part]
            story=_ "Malin Keshar was born 10 years after death of Haldric IV. He grew up in the northern border town of Hal'al, the second child and eldest son of the baron of the city. Every summer when the mountain passes became clear, orcs came down from the north to prove themselves in battle. Every year Hal'al's guards repelled the raids, though some of the townsfolk were always lost. Malin's father led raiding parties to disrupt the orc encampments and send the orcs back to the North."
        [/part]
        [part]
            story=_ "When Malin was 10, a mage who passed through the town sensed strong magical abilities in the boy. His parents, seeing a chance for him to live away from the constant battles with the orcs, arranged for him to be sent to the mage community on the Isle of Alduin. There he studied for eight years, while back at home the orc raids increased in their frequency and ferocity. Before Malin could finish his training, however, he was expelled."

            story=_ "Malin returned to Hal'al just as summer began only to encounter more misfortune. Even as he arrived, an early, unexpected orc raid was being conducted against Hal'al. Malin watched as his father took an arrow in the chest and fell lifeless to the ground."

            story=_ "Shaken by the loss of their commander, the human defense began to falter. As the orcs roared in anticipation of victory, skeleton warriors poured out of the woods to the orc's rear. The soldiers watched in amazement as the skeletons cut down orc after orc and then melted back into the forest."

While I know your kingdom does not love my kind, I think it vital that we put aside our differences for the moment. The orc menace grows in the North, and I misdoubt any of the border towns can stand without some assistance. For now, I ask only to rest in your town for a few days.'"

Upon your departure, however, you are banished from these lands, not to return on pain of death. We thank you for your help, but need no alliances with those who deal only in dark magic.'"

The news that came back was better than good. Mal-Ravanal was dead! Soldiers of Wesnoth had defeated him at about the same time the mermen had defeated the undead at Jotha. With the evil wizard gone, the mermen relaxed and began rebuilding in earnest, and soon Jotha was restored."

The visiting priestesses did much to console the families of the dead, and as it always does, life continued. In a few months, the giggles of children could be heard echoing through the shallows. Many of those children were named after Kai Krellis, Gwabbo, Cylanna, and the other heroes."

# Hopefully Kai Krellis is at least half leveled up
# already. Otherwise, this can be painful. Recruit a buch of citizens
# and brawlers, and send them east with Krellis. Use citizens to lure
# the skeleton archer types into the water. They are easy pickings
# there for other citizens, brawlers, and Krellis. One of those guys
# gets Krellis half way up to level one. A few citizens should also
# survive to become brawlers. About the time you get Krellis leveled
# up, and you are thinking about retreating everyone else, the bats
# will arrive. Use hunters and initiates to clear a path back
# west. Send three or four expendable units with Krellis. Their job is
# only to keep him from getting stuck in a ZOC. Krellis runs for the
# corner, while the rest of the troops gain experience doing a
# fighting retreat from the skeletons, and other bad guys arriving in
# the middle of the map. Ignore gold for now. You don't need much on
# the next level.

# Killing all the enemy leaders will end the level, but that won't be
# easy. Killing any enemy is good though. Each one gives you a
# different bonus: Cash, a loyal bat, or a ring of strength.

# If one of the named enemies is killed, a variable is stored. That
# way, the same names won't get used in the last level.

He had also sent necromancers to attack the orcs, and even the elves, in a quest for undead soldiers of different races. It seemed that he also lusted for merfolk slaves.

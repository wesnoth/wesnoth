# Hopefully Kai Krellis is at least half leveled up
# already. Otherwise, this can be painful. Recruit a buch of citizens
# and brawlers, and send them east with Krellis. Use citizens to lure
# the skeleton archer types into the water. They are easy pickings
# there for other citizens, brawlers, and Krellis. One of those guys
# gets Krellis half way up to level one. A few citizens should also
# survive to become brawlers. About the time you get Krellis leveled
# up, and you are thinking about retreating everyone else, the bats
# will arrive. Use hunters and initiates to clear a path back
# west. Send three or four expendable units with Krellis. Their job is
# only to keep him from getting stuck in a ZOC. Krellis runs for the
# corner, while the rest of the troops gain experience doing a
# fighting retreat from the skeletons, and other bad guys arriving in
# the middle of the map. Ignore gold for now. You don't need much on
# the next level.

# Killing all the enemy leaders will end the level, but that won't be
# easy. Killing any enemy is good though. Each one gives you a
# different bonus: Cash, a loyal bat, or a ring of strength.

# If one of the named enemies is killed, a variable is stored. That
# way, the same names won't get used in the last level.

His only clue was the name the necromancer had spoken: 'Lord Ravanal'. He sent his swiftest scouts north and south along the coast to learn what they might about this Ravanal. The news they brought him was not good."

He had attacked the edges of the kingdom of Wesnoth, and was building a fearsome army of undead humans there. He had also sent necromancers to attack the orcs, and even the elves, in a quest for undead soldiers of different races. It seemed that he also lusted for merfolk slaves. Krellis' scouts reported that more dark armies were heading north."

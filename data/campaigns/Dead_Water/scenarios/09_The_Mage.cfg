# You need pierce and fire to take care of scorpions. Javelineers get
# one more level to shine. Diviners are also great. Hopefully you have
# Keshan and the storm trident because those will be very
# useful. Keshan is especially helpful in actually finding the
# mage. He can get there several turns ahead of even the fastest
# merman (after you take out most of the scorpions in the way), but of
# course you don't *need* him.

First, what Tyegëa had revealed about his ancestry gave him questions he could not answer. Second, he was nervous about the task ahead. He felt confidence in his people but feared paying too great a price in dead and wounded to pass Tyegëa’s test. He felt sometimes angry at Tyegëa for sending him on this extra journey, and sometimes grateful that she was willing to help at all."

Night was falling, and it was very dark beneath the trees, but Krellis was in a hurry, now that the end of their journey was in sight. He decided to go ashore and try to find the mage immediately."

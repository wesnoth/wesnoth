# This level is not too hard. Don't go too negative on gold, but
# recruit three or four high-level units. You need mostly leveled
# initiates for their magic ranged attacks. Keshan is a big help, and
# so is the unit with the storm trident. If you decide to go after the
# orc leader, wait until the undead are dispatched. Heal everyone,
# then assemble just to the north of his keep. Don't touch the ships
# or piers though! Wait until day time, then send in all the units
# with magical attacks. Use other units to keep the slurbows
# busy. Hopefully the leader won't kill anyone before your next
# turn. One more round of magical attacks should kill him before his
# recruits start beating you up. Killing the orc leader isn't really
# necessary, but he helps someone level up, and he has a fair bit of
# gold. The next level is much easier with lots of gold.

# A lot of the code here is to activate the orc side if the merfolk do
# anything wrong, and keep it passive until then. There is also some
# animation of the orcs coming out to tear down the keep after the
# first turn.

# You're welcome for the free, loyal brawler. There are two cages on the
# shore. One contains Keshan, a drake burner who can be *very* useful
# during the campaign, and the other contains a poacher named
# Siddry. He's not going to be much help here; you will have to work
# to keep him alive, and he won't come with you. However, if you
# succeed, he comes back in The Flaming Sword with some friends who
# are a big help taking villages in the beginning (and not much help
# thereafter). If Siddry lives, he will be stored in a variable until
# then. The shipwreck in the north contains a treasure chest with 100
# gold.
#
# Send someone north to get gold. Recruit about two castles, one of
# which should be all level 2's. Hopefully that includes at least one
# more healer. Healers are *essential* here. Any units close to
# leveling are especially good. Send everyone east. Be aggressive in
# taking out the troops and getting to the leader, but don't leave any
# units out and exposed. You should probably instigate the slave
# rebellion as night comes at the end of your first offensive. That
# will keep some the retalliation against you low, and slow down the
# saurians coming towards you from the north. When it's safe, rescue
# the drake, and try to get him some experience--carefully. After
# taking out the leader, you can recruit a unit or two as
# replacements, but you shouldn't need more than that. You should just
# be getting involved with the first wave from the north leader
# now. (He's slowed down by the water.) Sit tight around the castle
# until the enemy onslaught has thinned out. After that it should be
# no problem wiping out the other two leaders--if you have survived
# this far, you have quite a few high-level units.

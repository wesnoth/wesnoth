# This is a fairly easy level to give you a break. Go north, then lure
# wolves into the water where you can pick them off. You really should
# get a second healer leveled up here if you haven't yet. Netcasters
# and enchantresses are probably you next priorities. You'll want a
# bunch of both. There is a storm trident in the south-east. I would
# give it to a fighter. They are not very useful in this campaign, but
# they have a lot of hitpoints, so they can stay alive well. The
# trident will help him level quickly.

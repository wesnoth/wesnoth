# Get a couple quick lower-level units first to start taking
# gold. Also get some level one cannon fodder to help soak up the
# awesome damage capability of the first wave of monsters. Then,
# recall your most powerful units. You need firepower. You also could
# really use the slow ability of netcasters and entanglers. Two
# healers are probably a minimum. Slide the first units around the
# edges getting gold, because your income will be very negative in a
# hurry, and you probably need all the firepower you can get. Don't
# worry about gold too much though--you probably can't start the next
# scenario with more than the minimum. Keshan can handle the upper
# middle section himself. He is good against the tentacles, and even
# the cuttlefish if he stays healed. Put everyone else in the
# middle. Use your auras as much as possible: leadership and
# illuminate (Cylanna *is* a diviner by now isn't she?), and use
# "slows" to keep all your units from dying. You will probably lose a
# couple leveled-up ones anyway.

# The loyal cuttle fish isn't terribly useful, but cool to have
# anyway. It has to be a Cuttle Fish2 to work around a problem with
# the [advancefrom] tag. When he levels into a kraken, he is quite a
# bit nicer to have. (And pretty cool looking if I do say so myself.)

After a few days, they found some islands in their path. The infirm and young among the refugees needed a break from travel; Cylanna only vaguely remembered them, but thought they might be safe."

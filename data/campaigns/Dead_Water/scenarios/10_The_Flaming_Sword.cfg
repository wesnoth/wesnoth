# You defeat the lich to try to get the sword, but as soon as the lich
# drops it, Caladon teleports in and picks it up. Now, you need to
# defeat Caladon to get the sword. He grants you time to leave, which
# is actually a turn to remove any very damaged units from the
# vicinity as Caladon is pretty dangerous. You can attack him now, or
# wait a turn for him to get impatient and attack you. When he
# attacks, or you attack him, he summons fire guardians (stolen from
# UtBS). He does not also recruit, because that would just be
# mean. (There is no reason he would have much gold anyway.)

    # The variable "Caladon_leader_status" can be one of several values:
    # <empty>:   Caladon is not a leader. He is still a unit on side 1
    #
    # "passive": His side still has "controller=null" set. (He is
    # giving the mermen time to leave before attacking them.)
    #
    # "impatient": Caladon’s side now has "controller=ai" set. (He's
    # tired of waiting for the mermen to leave.) This is actually
    # *set* on the players turn, because Caladon’s side doesn't *get*
    # a turn until it is set. On his first turn after "impatient" is
    # set, he will say something and summon fire guardians.
    #
    # "angry": Player attacked Caladon. (...and Caladon summoned the
    # first fire guardians immediately, so he no longer has to on his
    # turn.)
    #
    # "leader": He is a normal leader now. He has started his turns,
    # and is summoning two fire guardians per turn.
    #
    # "dead":     Keeps any of the other events from happening.

    # The first_time_only moveto causes the sword's attacks to be
    # explained. The moved unit gets the option to take it.
    # If the unit takes it, a sword *object* is put on the hex, and
    # the unit gets it because he is standing there already.
    # If the unit does not take it, another moveto event is
    # added. This one is *not* first_time_only, but it does the same
    # thing without the explanation.  If a unit does not take the
    # sword, an [allow_undo] is added to the event.

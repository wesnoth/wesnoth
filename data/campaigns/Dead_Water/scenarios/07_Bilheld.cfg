# This scenario should be rated "R" for massive violence! Both sides
# can do lots of damage to the other. Here's where you can use all the
# piercing units you have. Hopefully you haven't been totally ignoring
# the spearman and warrior lines. Even level one units can do pretty
# high damage to drakes though, so you can level up some more
# here. Don't get any units besides piercing ones. Netcasters aren't
# really necessary, and one diviner is enough. Actually, don't get
# *any* units for about four turns. The drakes will take a while
# getting to you, so just take some villages and let your income
# work. Don't worry about *holding* the villages, you'll get a bonus
# in the end if you survive. Just worry about getting enough units
# that you do survive. Let the first wave of drakes come to
# you. You'll have the advantage in the water--even against high-level
# units. They will kill some of your weaker units, but you will do far
# more damage to them, and level up some new ones in the process. If
# you survive the first wave, you should be fine. You will have to do
# a little fighting on land, but you can stay mostly in villages at
# least. Just be careful about how many units can attack each of
# yours.

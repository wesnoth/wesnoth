Been a strange few days. Had to leave Dallben real quick. Grabbed as much stuff as we could in just a day, some food, some clothes, sis’s lucky bracelet... made off for Delwyn as quick as these old bones let me. Be a three day journey there, but I sended Harper ahead for Relana first. Said we’d meets her in the usual hiding spot in the swamp."

I don’t be keen on fighting no war with Wesnoth, but don’t really got no choice either. Harper’s still too younger to be leading anyone, and don’t seem like anyone else in the village be wanting the responsibility."

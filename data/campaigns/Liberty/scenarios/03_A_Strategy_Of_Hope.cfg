Been a strange few days. Had to leave Dallben real quick. We grabbed whatever we could in just a day, some food, some clothes, sis’s lucky bracelet... and made off for Delwyn as quick as these old bones would let me. It be a three day journey there for me, but I sended Harper ahead for Relana first. Said we’d meet her in the usual hiding spot in the swamp."

Don’t matter whoever’s the one giving out them orders, those stinkers in Weldyn always be making trouble for us countryfolk."

I guess, I don’t really got no choice either. Harper’s still too young to be leading anyone, and it don’t seem like anyone else in the village be suitable."

What would she say to me now? Probably something like, “Quit yapping ya old dog and focus on what you’re doing. What’s done is done. Just look at what’s ahead of ya and get them people to safety.” Cheeky, that one. But, she’d be right, I has me a responsibility to our people. Got a lot of trouble ahead of us..."

Months... seven months it’s been since the Crown did send a single guard here to help us. This Garard II be a pompous stinker, even worser than his pa! Us of these border towns Delwyn and Dallben already be poor and needy, yet alls ‘His Majesty’ can think of is tax, tax, tax, takin’ all our hard earned gold from us. Then he uses our gold to provoke more wars with more orcs just for personal glory and more land for them grubby nobles to lord over."

In all Annuvin Province, there won’t be nobody besting us in these swamps. We’re self-reliant out here. We gots our own trade routes and pacts of mutual defense. No need for them Wesnothians.

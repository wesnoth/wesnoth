The sun don’t really shine at all in these Grey Woods, but truth be told, I has been getting used to it more and more. Lounging out in the warm daylight, talkin’ with Erwen while watching them kids play out in the fields... those times were so long ago. Our lives weren’t never real peaceful, but back then, we had our homes and our friends and our family... now we be creatures of the dark."

How she used to be dragging me out on some silly little romp, a little job here and there for some gold or lil trinket, or sometimes just for fun... I never wanted to go, of course. I were always real lazy. Still am, even now."

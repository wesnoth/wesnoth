Going by boat along the Great River, we has been managing to avoid them Wesnothians, but being constantly on the lookout be real taxing. I truly be starting to feel that tiredness in my bones... old men like me should be sitting back at home, resting our grey bodies and watchin’ over them younger folk growing up. I don’t got no business here, running around as some outlaw. Maybe if I was ten years younger..."

Truths be told, I don’t know how this’ll be turning out, especially since I don’t be no social butterfly like sis were. Don’t like me no city folk really. But I’ll deal with them if I gots to."

            story= _ "From the Annals of Alduin, 98 YW

One score and eight years ago, in 70 YW, the King of Wesnoth and the Lord of Elensefar signed a treaty of trade and alliance in order to further the security of humankind. The realization of this treaty required the creation of a safe path between Weldyn and Elensefar, with all manner of hostile creature or beast scoured from these civilized lands. From Dan’Tonk, the establishment of Aldril and Carcyn secured the once hazardous passage alongside the Grey Woods, completing the way between the two cities. With this, the alliance can truly be deemed a coalition of men."

            story= _ "To commemorate the concordat, six years ago, the Lords of Weldyn and Elensefar decreed that a monument be erected in the heart of these once wildlands. We, the magi of Alduin, lent our services to demonstrate the full prowess and might of human magic. Above a series of old catacombs in a scant hill, we spent these years raising an immense stronghold from the earth’s living rock."

            story= _ "Completed, as it is on this day, this sentinel of the west now towers hundreds of paces tall, a great monolith looming sheer above the plains. The sight of these colossal walls, to even us magi, is both awe-inspiring and terrifying. So tall these towers peak and so mighty these walls arise that such a feat seems more like a force of nature than a work of man. That we have fashioned this mountain as insignificant humans is almost inconceivable. Halstead, as we have named it, is impenetrable. No one shall ever overcome these tidal waves of stone."

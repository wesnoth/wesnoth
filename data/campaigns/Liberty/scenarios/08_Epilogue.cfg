We got back to Dallben today, but the village were empty. There were a few bodies and some burned houses, but it weren’t raided or nothing. Must’ve been one of them Wesnoth patrols, curse those damned stinkers! When I first saw the scene with my eyes, I thoughts that we failed, that we was too late... but now that I thinks of it, it be real weird that so few died. The others must’ve escaped to somewhere. But I didn’t see any clues here."

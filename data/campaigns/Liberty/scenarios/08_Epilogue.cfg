We be heading back north now, toward Carcyn and Elensefar. Them patrols seems to be in real disarray, mostly seeming to be riding back south to regroup. It be looking like we really did disrupt Weldyn’s chain of command, least for now."

He be letting them walk all over him like some coward, but... that don’t be my problem anymore. I has me a village to worry about. I needs to get back, consult myself with Relana and figure out what to do next. We gots time now, with that Wesnoth army in chaos, but we can’t wait forever."

We gots back to Dallben today, but the village were empty. Were a few bodies and some burned houses, but it weren’t raided or nothing. Must’ve been one of them Wesnoth patrols, curse those damned stinkers! When I first seen the scene with my eyes, I thoughts that we failed, that we was too late... but now that I thinks of it, it be real weird that so few died. The others must’ve escaped to somewhere. But I didn’t sees any clues here."

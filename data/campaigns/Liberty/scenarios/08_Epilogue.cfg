We be heading back north now, toward Carcyn and Elensefar. Them patrols seems to be in real disarray, mostly seeming to be riding back south to regroup. It be looking like we really did disrupt Weldyn’s chain of command."

I has me a village to worry about. I need to get back, consult myself with Relana and figure out what to do next. We gots some more time now, but we can’t wait forever."

We got back to Dallben today, but the village were empty. There were a few bodies and some burned houses, but it weren’t raided or nothing. Must’ve been one of them Wesnoth patrols, curse those damned stinkers! When I first saw the scene with my eyes, I thoughts that we failed, that we was too late... but now that I thinks of it, it be real weird that so few died. The others must’ve escaped to somewhere. But I didn’t see any clues here."

Besides, she’ll say that I still gots me a little piece of her in Harper, so I should cherish the lass."

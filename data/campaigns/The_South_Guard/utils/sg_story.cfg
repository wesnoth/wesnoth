            {STORY: _"For eight years, the South Guard had defended the farms and homes surrounding the city of Westin, the capital of Wesnoth’s frontier province of Kerlath in the furthermost south. Under the command of Sir Loris, the South Guard kept Westin free from danger, having only to quash the occasional bandit or wild creature. Perhaps the only real unease came from the Aethenwood to the west, where the elves lived in reserved aloofness, indifferent to the doings of man. Traversing their land without permission was forbidden, but the elves rarely entered the lands of Kerlath in turn. Even further south in the wildlands, the ancient heart forest sprawled out in dense gloominess, ominous enough that even the elves eschewed entering, and only a few, scattered outlaws called it their home."}

Though undistinguished, Deoran’s family had a decorated history in the army of Wesnoth: his great-grandfather, Haldiel, had fought alongside Konrad I in the war to reclaim the throne, and his father, Leonard, had served as an officer for thirty years. Thus, with full trust in the young officer, King Haldric knighted Deoran and tasked him with riding to Westin to demand accounting from Sir Loris."}

Ethiliel stayed behind for a long while, not emerging from the caverns until the day had passed and it was well into the night. She offered a brief word of apology, but said nothing more as she led them back north toward Wesnoth. Deoran had to admit that he was elated that they had defeated the undead and were returning home, although the wearied, almost grieving mood of the elves was quite sombering."}

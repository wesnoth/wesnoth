# Geographical assumptions:
#
# This campaign was apparently designed before the geography of Wesnoth
# was fixed to the main map -- there was a reference in it to unknown forest
# south of the "Great River", which doesn't fit at all. To rescue this, the
# original tSG Great River has to be either the unnamed river running through
# the Aethenwood or off the map entirely. I've opted for the latter, thus the
# reference to Kerlath being "in the furthermost south", and renamed the river
# as the "Black River". Since the original campaign placed the "elvish woods"
# west of Westin, I'm supposing they're in fact a southern (off-map) lobe
# of the Aethenwood.

Only scattered few outlaws lived in the wildlands south of Kerlath, a bastion of the ancient heart forest of the Great Continent so dense and gloomy that even elves forbore from dwelling there."

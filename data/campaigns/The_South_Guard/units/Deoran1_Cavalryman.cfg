#
# Deoran is a cavalryman, because:
#    1) we need a pretty, fully-animated sprite to show new players (deoran's old one was very ugly)
#       (and new players don't realize this is just a head-swapped sprite; everything is new to them at this point. Cavalrymen don't show up in this campaign, so there's no point of comparison)
#    2) "charge" on level-ups is unnecessary complexity when new players are still figuring out how damage types work
#    3) if we're going to teach the player a unit line's stats, it may as well be one that they'll use elsewhere in Wesnoth

<span color='#c7c7c7'><i>If you’re a veteran player, you’ll notice that Deoran is based off the Cavalryman, but lacks the Cavalryman’s blade and impact resistances. This was done to simplify the unit, so as not to overwhelm new players.</i></span>"

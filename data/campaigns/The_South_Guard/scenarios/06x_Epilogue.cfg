As the sun began to rise into the sky, the light dimmed and great fog spread across the battlefield. The sound of fighting dispersed and soon, it was utterly silent as the elves withdrew from combat. The humans advanced cautiously, still in formation, still ready to strike at any sign of trouble."}

Yet Deoran’s voice was startlingly clear as he spoke to the men of Wesnoth, saying: <i>“Stop! Enough blood has been spilled today, human and elf alike. The Aethenwood is done fighting.”</i>

In full view of the line of infantry, man and elf shook hands. Ethiliel made a full, lengthy, teary apology."}

With their master’s power gone, the undead warriors fell back to lifelessness, crumbling into inanimate heaps of bones. The rusting wind floated across the battlefield in gentle streams, carrying with it the souls of the fallen and ascending toward the sky where the sun began to break through the ashen clouds.

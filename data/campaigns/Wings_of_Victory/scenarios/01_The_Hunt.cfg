            #po: "Vulcaniad" is an invented term analogous to "Olympiad",
            #po: referring to the period between two successive volcanic
            #po: eruptions. A "cycle" is an unspecified astronomically-based
            #po: time period roughly corresponding to a Drake generation.
            #po: A "flight" is an unspecified drake social construct,
            #po: roughly comparable to "tribe". The term derives from "fly",
            #po: not "flee".
            story= _ "My name is Reshan’lo, and I was in my youth the Recorder of the Flight of Kerath. It falls to me to report what came to pass in the 14th cycle of the 5th Vulcaniad — the greatest error of Kerath, the flight's downfall and with it my own."

            story= _ "For long cycles we Recorders of Morogor had watched the slow rising of the tides and the sinking of our islands. Each cycle it became slightly more difficult to feed our hatchlings. Newer flights scraped out a meager existence on islets of rock their grandsires would have scorned, and some turned their eyes enviously on the green expanses of the central islands. We feared a final war was nearly upon us."

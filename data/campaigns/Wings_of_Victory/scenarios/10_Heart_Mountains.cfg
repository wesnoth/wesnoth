# HM_Master.map has a central location for the flight and is suitable for
# transformations into the maps for Heart_Mountains, Fire_Meets_Steel, & Confrontation.
# This ensures the territory is identical between these scenarios, but allows covering
# different directions and changes like snow. To facilitate this, HM_Master was designed
# as connected 12x12 sections. For example, one section has the drake castle & it's villages.
#
# To make this map do the following conversions to HM_Master.map:
# Cut the bottom 12 rows of hexes from the map
# Place players 2-4 start locations clockwise starting in lower left around the map at each keep
# Place player 5 at lower-right most hex
# Kh->Ke, Ch->Ce - player 1 castle to encampment
# Vd->Vc - drake villages around player 1 encampment to hut
#
# This scenario is intended to be medium difficulty and to allow gold refill.

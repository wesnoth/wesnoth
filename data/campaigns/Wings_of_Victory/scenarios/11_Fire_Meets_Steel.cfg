# To make this map do the following conversions to HM_Master.map:
# Cut the top 12 rows of hexes from the map
# Cut the leftmost 24 columns of hexes from the map
# Set the snow covered encampment keep to player 2
# Kh->Kha, Ch->Cha - Player 1 castle to snowy human castle
# Mm->Ms, Hh->Ha, Fp->Fpa, Gs->Aa, Ww->Ai, Vc->Vca - Make map snowy
# Note: Dry terrain and tropical water is used on HM_Master next to lava flows, so they are
# not converted to snow, to provide additional mobility for the dwarves to start with.
#
# This scenario is intended to be hard difficulty and to allow recalling of many burner & fighter veterans.

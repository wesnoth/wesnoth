# This scenario is intended to be the hardest of the first three.
# Both sides are forced to recruit evenly (one of each type, then it repeats), to prevent
# recruiting only clashers, and for the player to gain experience using each unit type.
# xp earned is limited and a time limit in place so players can't use this as an xp factory

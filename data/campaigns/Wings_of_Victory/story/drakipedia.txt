  Straight Path" as a single word for drakish traditions of perpetual
  expansion and conquest.

* Great Ocean -- The Great Ocean is the name of the open seas that
  surround the archipelago of Morogor. The drakes believe it to end
  at the Abyss, a vast and deadly waterfall.

* Great Continent -- The great continent to the east of
  Morogor. Its existence is unknown to the drakes until the flight of
  Galun.

* Morogor -- Archipelago, located somewhere in the @"Great Ocean" east of the
  Green Isle and west of the Great Continent.

* Mount Morogor -- Volcanic mountain on the central island of the archipelago

* Vulcaniad -- The (irregular) period between consecutive eruptions
  of @Mount Morogor. The drake calendar is based upon it.
 
* Long Count -- The drake calendar based on @Vulcaniad and @Breeding cycles.

* Breeding cycle -- The time that passes between one egg laying to the next.

* Recorder -- Drakish scroll-keeper. The recorders are the only caste of
  Drake not determined by biology: they recruit their members from all
  of the other castes.

* Ceramics -- The drakes work metal, but are masters in the
  craftsmanship of making ceramics. Only the burners can generate
  the amount of heat to cure the pieces to full strength.

* Eyrie -- A drake home building, fortified. It contains the @breeding chambers

* Breeding Chambers -- Where the Breeders live under the Dominant's eye.

* Laying -- a period in the @"breeding cycle".

* Hatching --  a period in the @"breeding cycle".

* Hatchling -- A young drake that hasn't seen another generation
  hatch. The younger of the current generation of @hatchlings are the most
  aggressive is the behavior of the tribe.

* Fledgling -- A young drake that has seen another generation hatch. If
  the @flight can afford the loss of a generation they start the
  @Swarming.

* Breeder -- The female drake. They are rare since eggs that become
  breeders have to be handled with extra care. The number of breeders is
  also limited by the amounts of non-breeders around, since breeders
  can't take care of their food for themselves when laying. Drake
  breeders become fertile after the next hatching.

* Egg, Drake -- The caste the hatchling will belongs to is determined by
  the time it is laid.

* Flight -- Group of Drakes, lives in an @Eyrie, controlling a hunting
  range. Each tribe has one @Dominant, who confers mating privileges.

* Aspirant -- Male @Drake that has passed through a hormonal
  metamorphosis that makes him able to mate with the breeders. The
  secretion of the hormone is caused by hunt and combat actions in which
  the drake is involved.

* Dominant -- The @Aspirant that established as the drake
  leader, who has the final say on leading the tribe and has the most mating
  privileges with the breeders. Rarely, he may confer breeding privileges upon
  non-intendants for exceptional service.

* Intendant -- one of the Aspirant lieutenants of a Dominant. Traditionally he
  has one of each caste other than his own.  Additional Intendants
  are sometimes designated for special duties.  Intendants have some mating privileges.

* Swarm -- The @Swarmlings that have left the @eyrie to found a new one.

* Swarming -- The flight for a new drake @eyrie that recurs every

* Verkon, Drake -- Dominant of his @Flight. In this flight @Galun was bred.

* Long Prey -- Drake term for bipedal game (e.g., humans). Derived from "long pig", which is South Seas pidgin for human meat.

Part 2: The Flight
Each scenario is named after where they are, to help convey a sense of journeying and be understandable for players

This the dangerous journey the Flight of Galun undertakes. Things occur to shape Galun's perspective for
how drakes would best survive in this new land (previously, their culture is a group of flights in the Morogor Archipelago)
Galun's run-ins with the various races of wesnoth, and how they are more dangerous to deal with than the runners of Morogor,
inspires him to avoid confrontation with them, as they reproduce faster than the drakes do.
Find other things Galun can learn from the various battles along the way.

Part 3: The Nest
Exciting battle names for the defense of the new drake nest
Here, Galun's challenge is to protect the nest he has founded.

* Scenario 11: Fire Meets Steel
  * The Recorder tells us that, unknown to Galun, one of his Sky Drake
    volunteers was a spy for the Flight of Kerath. It disappears with
    several bags of provisions. No attempt was made on the breeding pens, so it
    becomes apparent to Galun that he must have gone back to Morogor.
  * Dwarves living in the region investigate the intruders.
  * Drake arrogance and dwarven stubbornness do not mix well. Battle ensues.
  * Dwarves have gryphon riders in this scenario.
  * Map has same area as Heart Mountains, except with the eyrie, nearby villages
    are converted to drake villages, and there is snow around as it is winter.

* Scenario 12: Confrontation
  * The Flight of Kerath attacks. Now Galun must fight his own kind in true war.
  * On victory, the Recorder of Kerath is captured; he and Galun meet
    for the second time.  The Recorder reminds Galun that the lesser
    races reproduce more quickly than do Drakes.
  * Map is same area as Fire Meets Steel, but it is now spring

* Scenario 13:  Epilogue
  * Story only
  * Galun's descendants must walk a tightrope between expanding
    too slowly (and falling prey to more aggressive drakes) and
    coming into destructive contact with the fast-breeding lesser
    races.
  * Galun proclaims the Edicts: (1) an end to slaveholding, (2) avoidance
    of confrontation with other speaking peoples, (3) use the long
    sleeps to cut food requirements.
  * Ultimately, the Drake Way will require expansion off Irdya itself.

    # This battle should be a relatively small-scale meeting engagement
    # in country that is wooded and mountainous, but scattered with
    # small human and dwarvish farms.  Aiglondur and his guards should
    # start from an underground keep on the west edge of the map, set
    # into the east edge of impassable mountains and marked "East Gate".

            story= _ "In the first few years after the founding of the Northern Alliance, the dwarves of Knalga and the human population of Dwarven Doors were fully preoccupied with rebuilding what had been broken by the long orcish occupation. But soon enough they prospered once again. The dwarves began mining their past for inspiration to rebuild Knalga even greater than before, and began also reaching out for contact with their scattered kinfolk."

In the year 550 after the founding of Wesnoth, the captain of the East Gate received a warning that a small band of rogue orcs had been sighted."

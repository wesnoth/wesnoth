    # This scenario will take place on a throneroom map which is, effectively,
    # all castle.  It should have two keep hexes on it, one near the front
    # for our heroes and one at the rear for Karrag. Features of the
    # map must include an indication of a doorway in the cave wall near the
    # rear dais.  The throneroom map should in general look like a distorted
    # mirror image of Hamel's, but with the braziers unlit.
    #
    # Aiglondur, Angarthing, and a few of their veteran followers face Karrag,
    # flanked by several of his followers.  Dulcatulos escorts our heroes.
    # Karrag's group should have black team disks and Dulcatulos a blue one.

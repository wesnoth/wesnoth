    # The map should be a twisty, narrow path through rugged snow-capped
    # mountains. The objective will be to get Aiglondur through to the
    # other side. The opponents will be gryphons, wolves, and the elements.
    # We should try to get creative with representing the effects of extreme
    # cold, perhaps something like the dehydration effect in UtBS. And the
    # time-limit should be tight.

    # The map should be thematically something like a reflection of the one
    # for "At The East Gate", but on a larger scale.  The player’s
    # encampment should be at the west edge.  Kal Kartha will be
    # represented by an underground keep (the West Gate) set into
    # high mountains at the east edge of the map.

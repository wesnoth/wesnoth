    description= _ "A Witness functions as the eyes of the dwarvesâ€™ history, a deep lore that they never share with outsiders. The presence of a Witness instils dwarvish warriors with the knowledge that their deeds (and their deaths) will not go unrecorded, inspiring them to daunting deeds and great heroics. The person of a Witness is considered sacred, and Witnesses are often used as envoys between dwarvish clans."

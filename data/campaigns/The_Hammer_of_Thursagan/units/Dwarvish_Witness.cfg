# This unit is designed to be a bit tougher and more combat-capable
# than an Evish Shaman, but distinctly weaker than a Dwarvish
# Fighter. It is deliberately expensive, as the boosted leadership
# ability is powerful.

The presence of a Witness inspires dwarvish warriors with the knowledge that their deeds (and their deaths) will not go unrecorded.  They learn a fighting style deliberately unlike that of their fellows, one designed to turn the vaunted strength of the dwarves against itself.  The person of a Witness is considered sacred, and Witnesses are often used as envoys between dwarvish clans."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_LEADERSHIP}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SLOW}

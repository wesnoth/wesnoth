#	A short list of easter eggs or other hidden goodies in this campaign
#	Some are old, some are new, some are secret, and some are well-known
#	Something counts as a hidden goodie if the effect is not advertised or must be discovered somehow
#	The list doesn't include any of the "pop-up" monsters, which are at best annoying
#	- if you defeat any leaders in Elves Besieged, the orcish army is weakened enough such that there are far fewer ambushes in Crossroads
#	- if you completely liberate Blackwater Port on HARD, you are given a free knight
#	- if you completely eliminate the undead presence on the Isle of the Damned, Moremirmu joins your party
#	- if you do not completely eliminate the undead presence on the Isle of the Damned, Moremirmu returns to help you in the Valley of Death
#	- if you are a pacifist towards the gryphons on Gryphon Mountain (including not getting the eggs), they assist you in battle when you return to Wesnoth
#	- if you bring outlaws with you from the Isle of the Damned to the Dwarven Doors, it unlocks a hidden unit who tells you the location of the true entrance to the Dwarven kingdom
#	- if you examine a certain area of wall in Plunging Into the Darkness, you open a cave that releases a Giant Spider -- and a chest full of gold
#	- if you bring a merman to a section of deep water in The Lost General, you can rescue a trapped dwarf
#	- if you keep your ally leader alive in The Lost General, he allows you to recruit Dwarvish Guardsmen
#	- if you bring a merman to The Sceptre of Fire, you get a bonus line of dialog.
#	- if you bring a merman to the start of the River Longlier, you will unlock a series of two bonus scenarios
#	- if you help the wose in a bonus scenario you get a book which grants special powers to the reader
#	- if you visit the Elvish great tree living on the Plains of Snow, you are given a magical flaming sword
#	- if you kill one of the Death Knights in the Swamp of Dread, it will drop a strong piece of armor
#	- if you kill all 4 of the Death Knights in the Swamp of Dread, it severely weakens the Lich, dropping its HP by half
#	- if you kill Asheviere with one of the three main human characters, you are treated to different coup-de-grace speeches
#	- if a unit is attacked and mortally wounded, but the attacker is killed on the very next attack by Konrad, and the unit lives until the start of the next turn, the unit becomes loyal > not finished yet

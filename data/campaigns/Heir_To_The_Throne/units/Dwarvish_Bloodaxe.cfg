    description= _ "According to legend, the mystical bloodaxes were forged at the dawn of time in the great stone-fires of Dhur Darihm, when all Irdya was still drowned in flame and soot. It is with them that the first dwarves made war against the troll-mother, laying low her people and forevermore claiming dominion in the underearth.

While the truth of this legend is a matter of debate, battlefield reports leave no doubt that such weapons exist, and that they confer great resilience upon their wielder. The dwarvesâ€™ few remaining bloodaxes are jealously guarded, passed down from father to son and reclaimed from the fallen even at great cost."

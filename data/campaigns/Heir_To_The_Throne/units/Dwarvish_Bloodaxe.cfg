It is with them that the first dwarves made war against the troll-mother, laying low her people and forevermore claiming dominion in the underearth." + "

" + _ "While the truth of this legend is a matter of debate, battlefield reports leave no doubt that such weapons exist, and that they confer great resilience upon their wielder. The dwarves’ few remaining bloodaxes are jealously guarded, passed down from father to son and reclaimed from the fallen even at great cost."

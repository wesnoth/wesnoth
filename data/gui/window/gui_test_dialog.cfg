When that happens, try to learn from your mistakes: watch the replay, try to understand what you did wrong, then <ref>dst='saveload' text='restart the scenario'</ref> and try again.

#When you first start playing, you will probably lose some scenarios. That is normal, and is part of learning the game. When that happens, try to learn from your mistakes: watch the replay, try to understand what you did wrong, then <ref>dst='saveload' text='restart the scenario'</ref> and try again." + _ "

#Some common reasons for losing a scenario are:" + _ "

#• Playing a campaign at too high a <ref>dst='..gameplay' text='difficulty level'</ref>. Try restarting the scenario at an easier difficulty." + _ "

#• Playing a poor strategy: for example, recruiting the wrong types of units, fighting at the wrong <ref>dst='time_of_day' text='time of day'</ref>, not taking advantage of terrain features or units’ special abilities, and so on." + _ "

#• Missing clues. Often there will be hints in the campaign’s story and dialog about what to expect from a difficult scenario and how to prepare for it. If you have a loyal mage on your side, take the time to listen to its advice; it may save your life." + _ "

#• Barely scraping a victory in a previous scenario. Campaigns generally assume that you will have some <italic>text='carryover gold'</italic> and some experienced units on your <italic>text='recall list.'</italic> (These concepts are explained in the tutorial.) If you win a scenario but lose most of your experienced units and much of your gold, the following scenario may be very difficult to beat, even for a more experienced player. If you find yourself in this situation, you may try to go back a scenario or two and win them more convincingly, or change to an easier difficulty. (However, remember that <italic>text='some'</italic> losses are expected, particularly at higher difficulties.)" + _ "

#• Poor gold management. At higher difficulties, managing gold — capturing villages to increase the income, and using low-level units and fresh recruits to reduce the spending — becomes important. If you use many high-level units, you might win a scenario easily but have not enough gold carryover for the next scenario. (This would be an example of “barely scraping a victory”.)"

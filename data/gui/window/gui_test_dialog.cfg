Click on the unit you wish to move to select it, then click on the hex you wish to move it to. When a unit is selected, everywhere it can move this turn will be highlighted, and all other hexes on the map are made dull. Mousing over a highlighted hex shows the defense rating the unit would have if you moved it to that hex. Mousing over a dull hex will also show the number of turns required to reach it, and clicking will cause the unit to move towards it by the fastest route over this and subsequent turns. If you don’t use up all of a unit’s movement when you first move a unit, you may move it again. This is useful when having two units switch places. Attacking with a unit will use up its movement. Ending a move in a village you don’t already own will also use up a unit’s movement, but will still allow it to attack." + _ "

#Each unit has a certain number of movement points which are used up when moving into a new hex, depending on the Terrain of that particular hex. For instance, grassland nearly always costs 1 movement point to enter. Exactly how many movement points are spent entering a hex depends on the unit type — in forest, elvish units only spend 1 movement point, most human and orc units spend 2, while horsemen spend 3. You can learn how many movement points a unit requires to enter a certain terrain type by right-clicking on it, selecting <bold>text='Unit Description'</bold>, and then looking at <bold>text='Terrain Modifiers'</bold>." + _ "

label = _ "Another thing to keep in mind while moving is <italic>text='zones of control'</italic>. Each unit — except for level 0 units — generates a zone of control in the hexes immediately surrounding it, and any enemy unit entering those hexes immediately ends its movement. Learning how to use zones of control to your advantage is an important part of Wesnoth, as only <ref>dst='ability_skirmisherskirmisher' text='skirmishers'</ref> can ignore zones of control." + _ "

To see where the enemy can move to during their next turn, press Ctrl-v or Cmd-v. Ctrl-b or Cmd-b shows where the enemy could move, if your units were not on the map to block their progress."

#• <bold>text='Red and yellow'</bold> if it has moved (or attacked), can still move further, but it can no longer attack.
#    • This can happen due to campaign-specific events or abilities, for example the <italic>text='disengage'</italic> ability in the campaign <italic>text='Under the Burning Suns'</italic>.
#• <bold>text='Blue'</bold> for allied units, except during that ally’s own turn.
#    • During the ally’s own turn, their units will be shown with the colors showing whether the units can still move and attack; however their moves, and the corresponding orb changes, are delayed as explained in <ref>dst='shroud_and_fog' text='Shroud and Fog of War'</ref>.

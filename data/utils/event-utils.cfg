# This file contains shortcuts for common WML events (such as prestart, side
# turn, and such), which can be used to write events faster and in less space.
#
# It is recommended that you only use these if you're confident you could write
# the expanded form as well; these are mostly intended as shortcuts for
# experienced WML authors.
#
# These don't depend on any other macros.  Please don't change this.


#define ON_EVENT NAME ACTION
# Creates a generic event.  Strictly a syntactic shortcut
    [event]
        name={NAME}
        {ACTION}
    [/event]
#enddef

#define ON_PRESTART ACTION
# Creates an event that triggers when the scenario starts but before the user
# gets any visible output.  Strictly a syntactic shortcut.
#
# For example, you can make side 2 start the scenario with ownership of the
# village at 13,15:
#
# {ON_PRESTART (
#   [capture_village]
#       side=2
#       x,y=13,15
#   [/capture_village]
# )}
    [event]
        name=prestart
        {ACTION}
    [/event]
#enddef



#define ON_START ACTION
# Creates an event that triggers when the scenario starts, after the map is
# displayed but before the player can act.  Strictly a syntactic shortcut.
#
# For example you could display some dialogue when the scenario starts:
#
# {ON_START (
#   [message]
#       speaker=Konrad
#       message= _ "Hey, I can see some enemies up ahead!"
#   [/message]
#
#   [message]
#       speaker=Delfador
#       message= _ "Yes, so it would seem. Charge!"
#   [/message]
# )}
    [event]
        name=start
        {ACTION}
    [/event]
#enddef

# {ON_NEXT_TURN (
# Creates an event that triggers at the end of every turn.
#
# For example, you could give a player some gold at the end every turn:
#   [gold]
#       amount=35
#       side=1
#   [/gold]
# )}

#define ON_NEXT_TURN ACTION

        {ACTION}
    [/event]
#enddef

#define ON_NEXT_TURN_ONCE ACTION
# Creates an event that triggers at the end of the current turn.
# For example you could give a player some gold before his/hers next turn.:
# {ON_NEXT_TURN (
#   [gold]
#       amount=100
#       side=1
#   [/gold]
# )}
    [event]

        {ACTION}
    [/event]
#enddef

#define ON_SIDETURN ACTION
# Creates an event that triggers at the start of every players turn
# For example, you could set each players gold to a fixed amount every turn.
# {ON_SIDETURN (
#   [modify_side]
#       side=3
#       gold=0
#   [/modify_side]

        {ACTION}
    [/event]
#enddef


#define ON_TURN TURN ACTION
# Creates an event that triggers at the start of turn TURN
# For example you can create a Wose belonging to player 1 at turn 3:
# Strictly a syntactic shortcut.
# {ON_TURN 3 (
#   [unit]
#       side=1
#       type=wose
#       x,y=12,4
#   [/unit]

        {ACTION}
    [/event]
#enddef

#define ON_LAST_TURN ACTION
# Creates an event that triggers when the last turn ends.

#       speaker=narrator
#       message="They suck!"
#   [/message]
# )}

#   speaker=narrator
#   message="Aww.. you lost. Try again with 800g and +40g income?"
#   [/message]
# )}

        name=defeat
        {ACTION}

#define ON_TILE X Y FILTER ACTION
# Creates an event that triggers anytime a unit steps on a given tile.
# The filter can be used to only affect special units, or units of a
# given player.  
#
# For example, we could make a tree where the first player's leader can 
# read a note, but noone else:
# {ON_TILE 5 7 (
#   side=1
#   canrecruit=1
# ) (
#   [message]
#   speaker=narrator
#   message="This is a note."

#enddef

#define ALLOW_UNDO
# Allows the player to undo the effects of a moveto event.
# Strictly a syntactic shortcut.

# 		message="This is a note."
# 	[/message]
# 	{ALLOW_UNDO}

#define ON_TILE_ONCE X Y FILTER ACTION
# Creates an event that triggers the first time a unit steps on a
# given tile.  The filter can be used to only affect special units, or
# units of a given player.  

For example we could make a text-message
# that is only readable once:
# {ON_TILE_ONCE 5 7 () (
#   [message]
#       speaker=narrator
#       message="This is a note."
#   [/message]
# )}
    [event]
        name=moveto

#define ON_DEATH FILTER ACTION
# Creates an event that triggers anytime a unit matching FILTER dies.

    [/event]
#enddef

#define ON_DEATH_ONCE FILTER ACTION
# Creates an event that triggers the first time a unit matching FILTER
# dies. Strictly a syntactic shortcut.
#
# For example we can make only player 3s leader units scream in
# pain upon death:
# {ON_DEATH_ONCE (
#   side=3
#   canrecruit=1
# ) (
#   [message]
#       speaker=unit
#       message="AAaaaaAAaaAAaarrrghh!!!"

#enddef

#define ON_POSTADVANCEMENT FILTER ACTION
# Creates an event that triggers after any unit matching FILTER
# advanced to a new class.  Strictly a syntactic shortcut.
#
# For example we could make it claim to be

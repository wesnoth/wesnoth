    text= _ "The ancient history of the drakes is told mainly by the legends of the glider caste, who have preserved millennia of knowledge across generations. The glider legends stretch back millions of years, yet the earliest legends are generally doubted by the historians of Wesnoth and most other lands.

The drakes are believed to be descendants of an ancient race of dragons that is said to have been born millions of years ago during the legendary Time of the Beginning. The dragons are among the oldest of races, and old legends suggest they initially thrived along Irdya's poles, then much hotter than they are today. Over time some of these dragons would morph into the drakes of today.

The earliest important story of the drakes begins over two million years ago, in a time known as the Time of Fate, when the mysterious evil of the Faerie is said to have arrived in Irdya. The tellers, ancestors of the modern Fire Wraiths, failed to warn the drakes of it as the Faerie’s immense power silenced them, and they created cataclysmic cooling all around Irdya. The world changes massively, and many new races arrived into the world.

The Fire Dragons lead the drakes away from the freezing poles to the tropics, which had still retained some of Irdya’s ancient heat. The drakes from the northern pole formed the burner caste, and those from the south formed the glider caste. As the poles turned into an unlivable wasteland, they became known as the Moonlit Wastes.

Those Fire Wraiths who failed to warn the drakes grew smaller and weaker in time as the world grew colder, slowly retreating to the fiery depths of the hottest volcanoes in Irdya. Their descendants are now the Fire Elementals of today.

Around twenty thousand years ago, the Time of Legend begins. Through the feeble efforts of the tellers, Irdya slowly began to warm once more, and the drakes rule a world-spanning tribal confederation that comes to include saurians, nagas and even dwarves.

The next major age is the Time of Turmoil, which begins around eleven thousand years ago. In this time the faerie creatures mysteriously began to attack all the races, including the drakes. The drakes lost their connections to the saurians and nagas as they retreat towards the swamps, and the dwarves bury themselves deep underground. A league of various drakes, dwarves and humans joined together to fight the Faerie on the Western Continent, yet they largely fail as the Faerie Realm unleashes destructive creatures including savage orcs into Irdya.

In this time it is said that Dominant Morogor captures a mysterious artifact named the Ruby of Fire. Six thousand years later, the Ruby was said to be given a group of humans from the Silver Order for safekeeping by a drake windshaper named Witwegana. However, the Ruby is generally believe to have been intercepted by the Lich-Lord Levland. Witwegana challenged Levlan to a duel afterwards, and died as a result.

The powerful Dominant Morogor became enraged upon the death of his love, and betrayed the other races of Irdya, yet he was defeated by Enforcer Parapathos. The Drakes are then banished to a chain of islands in the middle of the Great Ocean known as Morogor, in an event known as the Exile. Dominant Morogor forbade the telling of all history before this, though some details have been said and are known to this day.

From here, the history of the drakes becomes more widely known and trusted by historians. The drakes would sometimes have some contact with the humans of the Green Isle, yet they remained greatly isolated for many thousands of years, until around 3 YW, when they began to leave the sinking Isles of Morogor. Most would settle in the Great Continent, where they raided Elensefar and Wesmere and built an Eyrie north of Wesmere, founded by Gorlack. Some others settled with Dominant Karron in the Green Isle.

In the centuries afterwards, the Drakes would settle around the continent, especially in the Northlands, where some would form large kingdoms around hot volcanoes."

The Drakes have a lengthy yet little-known history stretching back many millennia. They are among the oldest of races, descendants of primordial Fire Dragons. Much of drakish history is preserved by the glider caste, who keep millennia of knowledge. Their histories begin millions of years ago, though the oldest stories are believed to be merely ancient myths, and are doubted even by some drakes. Historians of other races tend to mark anything before the exile as mythical tales.

Age of Myths:

The first of the ages recorded by the glider caste is the Time of Beginning, supposedly an ancient age of Irdya that predates the times of the exile by millions of years. The old legends say this was a long time of peace, where drakes thrived along Irdya’s poles, which were then warm lands. The long peace was disturbed by the arrival of the Faerie over 2 million years before the exile. This arrival was sudden and catastrophic, and even the mighty Fire Wraiths were silenced by the arrival of this mythical force, unable to warn the other races of what was about to come. Many new otherworldly races, including our modern humans, nagas, and dwarves, would arrive to Irdya during this time, as the world experienced cataclysmic cooling that forced the drakes to tropical regions. It is said that the Drakes of the south pole formed the burner caste, and those of the north became the gliders. Then came the Time of Legend, which began fifteen thousand years before the exile, and is believed by the gliders to have been marked by the warming of Irdya through the great efforts of the Fire Wraiths, and the formation of a great confederation of drakes, saurians, nagas and some dwarves. Around nine thousand years later, the Time of Turmoil began, when a great war between the Faerie and all other races, including the drakes, began, and the savage orcs were released.

Exile and Morogor:

Six thousand years after the Time of Turmoil began, the true history of the Drakes begins with the exile. In this time the ancient Dominant Morogor became enraged upon the death of Witwegana to the lich Levlan and betrayed the other races of Irdya. Yet Enforcer Parapathos defeated him, and the drakes were banished to a remote island chain named Morogor. Dominant Morogor forbade the telling of all history beforehand. For five thousand years afterwards, the drakes remained highly isolated in Morogor, rarely encountering humans from the Green Isle, who sometimes shipwrecked into drakish lands. A handful of times, human ships would raid drakish coasts. Islefolk records show that Haldric fought the drakes in battle while sailing towards the Great Continent. As the Isle of Morogor began to slowly sink, the drakes began to leave Morogor around 3 YW. The Drakes arrived on the Great Continent for the first time in millennia, where they allied with local saurians against humans. They raided Elensefar and Wesmere, where they caused great forest fires through their flames. An eyrie was built north of Wesmere in the mountains of the Northlands. Some drakes would leave to the Green Isle in this time.

The War on Prey and beyond:

From 4 to 20 YW 24 flights of drakes arrived on the Great Continent, many raiding the cities of Western Wesnoth and Wesmere. Elensefar was burned several times in this period. Wesnothians used their cavalry against isolated drakish hunting packs to retaliate against the constant raids. Some early human cities are entirely destroyed by drakish fire. This war became known as the War on Prey. Around 20 YW the drake dominants were summoned by Gorlack to a grand council. The drakes adopt the Windpath of the Great Contention, and come to see their prey as contenders in a contest for continental control. Some years after the War on Prey the saurian capital of Saurgrath was destroyed by elvish forces. After this the drakes settled in isolated regions of the continent, many in the Northlands. There they formed many small kingdoms, especially around warm volcanoes, such as the great Ashen’s Maw. Many centuries after arriving to the Great Continent, the drakes of many parts of the continent would form an apex civilization."

The Wesnothian calendar begins with the founding of Wesnoth in the year 1 YW (Year of Wesnoth). Years before that are counted based on the number of years before the founding of Wesnoth using BW (Before Wesnoth).

After the fall of Wesnoth many switched to using AF (After the Fall) and BF (Before the Fall)."

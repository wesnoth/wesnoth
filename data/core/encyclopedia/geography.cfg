    id=kingdom_wesnoth
    title= _ "Kingdom of Wesnoth"
    text= _ "The Kingdom of Wesnoth is located in the north-central portion of the <ref>dst='great_continent' text='Great Continent'</ref>. Most of the mainline campaigns revolve around it. It is bounded on the map by the Great River to the north, the shore of the Great Ocean to the west, the Aethenwood to the <ref>dst='southwest_elven_lands' text='southwest'</ref>, and the Bitter Swamp to the southeast (lower right corner of the main map).

Over the River Aethen, south of Fort Tahn, is a Wesnothian frontier region. It is bounded to the south (off-map) by dense woods of which the Aethenwood may be considered a northernmost extension.

<header>text='Notable cities:'</header>
    • Weldyn: The capital of Wesnoth.
    • Aldril: City lying on the Bay of Pearls.
    • Blackwater Port: City lying south of the Bay of Pearls.
    • Carcyn: Located between the Grey Woods and the Great River.
    • Dan’Tonk: Wesnoth’s largest city, located in the center of the country, just west and north of Weldyn.
    • Soradoc: The northernmost border outpost of Wesnoth, controls the confluence of the Weldyn River and the Great River.
    • Fort Tahn: The southernmost border outpost, controls the north/south road crossing the River Aethen.
    • Tath: Important fort city north of Dan’Tonk, exerts control over the wilderness country around the east of the Brown Hills and north to the Ford of Abez.

<header>text='Notable land features:'</header>
    • Gryphon Mountain: Home of the fabled Gryphons.
    • Ford of Abez: Shallow part of the Great River, it is usually controlled by Wesnothian forces.
    • Weldyn River: It branches from the Great River and goes south.
    • Great Central Plain: Area bounded by Weldyn, Dan’Tonk, and Fort Tahn, this plain is Wesnoth’s bread basket and home to most of its population.
    • Dulatus Hills: These rolling hills bordering the Great Central Plain provide much of Wesnoth’s livestock and agriculture.
    • Brown Hills: Wasteland surrounding Gryphon Mountain that is not well-populated and occasionally very dangerous.
    • Horse Plains: Region of rolling plains just south of the Great River, bounded by Glyn’s Forest to the west and the River Weldyn to the east; the southern reach merges into the Central Plain. Home of the powerful Clans; the best horses in Wesnoth are bred here.
    • Estmark Hills: Largish range rising south of the Great River and east of the Weldyn River. The northernmost portion, nearest the River Weldyn, has at various times been settled by Wesnothians, but the Kingdom’s control is tenuous at best and banditry is common.
    • Glyn’s Forest: Sometimes known as the Royal Forest, named for one of Haldric II’s sons.
    • Gray Woods: Large forest in the heart of the wilds of Wesnoth, located between Carcyn and Aldril and generally considered to be haunted."

Its borders are the Great River to the north, a loosely defined line with Wesnoth to the east, the Bay of Pearls to the south, and the <ref>dst='great_ocean' text='ocean'</ref> to the west. More information is found in the historical narrative of Wesnoth.

<header>text='Notable cities:'</header>
    • Glamdrol: An Orcish tribal capital.
    • Wesmere: The location of the Ka’lian — the Elvish Council.

    • Dallben and Delwyn: Human villages originally built by settlers who crossed the Great River during Wesnoth’s Golden Age expansion. Now abandoned. The forested area northeast of Elensefar, where these villages were located, was named the Annuvin province by men but was known by the elves as Wesmere.

<header>text='Notable land features:'</header>
    • Heart Mountains: A virtually impassable barrier between the river country and the Northern Plains.
    • Heartfangs: the particularly forbidding stretch of high peaks southwest of Lake Vrug and north of the Forest of Wesmere. The most inhospitable and dangerous portion of the Heart Mountains; only hermits, madmen, and mages live there.
    • Swamp of Dread: a very large bog located between the Heart Mountains and the Great River. A notoriously dangerous place.
    • Lake Vrug: A large mountain lake whose river carves the only pathway through the Northern Mountains.
    • Arkan-thoria: The river that comes out of Lake Vrug. This is the elvish name; among humans it is called Longlier.
    • River Listra: The south-running tributary of the Great River into which the Arkan-thoria empties.
    • Lintanir Forest: The southernmost portion of the Great Northern Forest, a gigantic wood whose eastern and northern boundaries are known only to the elves. Their capital, Elensiria, has only seldom been visited by humans.

To the east lie the Unaligned Tribes of the Wild Steppe, who fell out of the control of the Clannate, instead roaming with wild human barbarians and clashing with the High Elves of the North Plains (known as North Elves in human lands). The High Elves themselves reside further east, where it is rumored they rule a vast kingdom.

These images are here to ensure the scons conftests that check for image type support work. The contents of the actual images themselves don't matter other than there is an image per officially supported image format.

They are in this directory because some people and Linux distros use the source tarball to build from, and these images need to be present for them as well.

DO NOT USE THESE IMAGES IN ANY GAME DATA FILES.
DO NOT REFERENCE THESE IMAGES FROM ANYWHERE ELSE.
DO NOT REMOVE THESE IMAGES.

    description= _ "The ghast is a creature taken from humankindâ€™s most primal nightmares. Unlike their lesser cousins, ghouls and necrophages, ghasts are not patient enough to wait for their victim to die from poison before consuming the body. They attack directly with their enormous mouths, trying to rip the flesh straight from their foes. Once their enemy is defeated, they eat the rest of the body, gaining strength in the process."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_POISON}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_FEEDING}

    description= _ "Although orcs tend to be fairly tribal in nature, from time to time, a situation arises that impels several clans to join forces under a single powerful sovereign. By virtue of the station, such an orc must possess both the strength and cunning to lead a great horde of warriors, almost invariably possessing an inherent charisma that is an exceptional rarity among their kind. The path to such a status is a varied one; sometimes, a powerful tribe may conquer lesser ones and absorb the defeated warriors into their ranks, while other circumstances demand appointing by a council of shamans, where the Sovereign becomes a temporary, but formal title. In either case, the warchief is the critical linchpin of the horde, which rapidly dissolves back into individual clans once the strength of its leadership is extinguished."

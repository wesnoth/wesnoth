    description= _ "Skilled orcish assassins are surprisingly nimble covert troops who achieve great agility by forgoing the heavy armor of their brethren. Their weapon of choice, poison, is often criticized as a vicious tool unsuited for the established customs of typical warfare. Most orcs, however, recognize no such laws of combat and seek to attain victory by any means necessary. Defeat, no matter the reason, is usually treated as the greatest dishonor possible. The brutal nature of the total war that orcs engage in is precisely what gives rise to these ruthless soldiers, rightly dubbed ‘Slayers’ by their enemies."

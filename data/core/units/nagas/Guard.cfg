    description= _ "Nagas tend to value agility and grace on the battlefield, but the slower, stronger individuals play a key role in defending important positions. These guards are not often encountered, for they do not take part in raids or mercenary activities. They are said to have a strong code of honor, though like all things naga, it is mostly a mystery to outsiders."

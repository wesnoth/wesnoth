    description= _ "Elves are typically peaceable by nature and most will attack only in retaliation for some wrongdoing wrought upon them. However, there are some elves who deliberately seek battle, purposeful or otherwise, for their own enjoyment. Through constant combat, these warriors either learn to hone their swordsmanship to a level far beyond most of their peers or perish in the volatile frenzy of melee. Those capable of persisting eventually grow skilled enough to wholly conquer the battlegrounds, becoming veritable champions of war as they mercilessly cut through their foes. Having spent their whole lives refining their prowess with the blade, these elves are exceptionally dangerous and should never be underestimated."

    description= _ "Although the equines bred by the wood elves are much faster and more agile than regular horses, they tend to be quite a bit harder to master. It takes many years to train these fickle ponies, but once tamed, they are among the most devoted mounts. These unique horses allow Elvish horsemen to outpace most other cavalry on open ground and even ride through thick forests at full gallop. Though these riders possess some skill in wielding swords and bows, their greatest effectiveness lies in their ability to scout and outmaneuver enemy forces. Elvish scouts are most often used as messengers or support units and are adept at quickly transferring information between patrols, whom they also reinforce when necessary."

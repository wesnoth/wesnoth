    description= _ "Succession among the Elvish nobility is a complex process that varies somewhat between the different enclaves of Elvenkind. Typically, the future leaders of the elves are tasked with governing the three-fold aspects of Elvish society: warriors and rangers who defend the forests, peaceable civilians who shy away from combat altogether, and the collective group of healers and mystics who study the art of faerie magic. Being able to reconcile the differences between these factions and effectively lead their people requires considerable personal merit and a deep insight into elves of all kinds. To this end, lords are typically the only male elves who are allowed to learn any amount of faerie magic, which is traditionally taught solely to female shamans.

Though some enclaves, such as the northern Lintanir grove, maintain their nobility via bloodline, others such as the mighty Wesmere elves elect new lords on each new generation. In either case, the noblesâ€™ position is rarely an absolute one, and they are expected to lead more by diplomacy and wisdom rather than force."

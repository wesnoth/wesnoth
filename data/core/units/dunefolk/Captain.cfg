    description= _ "Traditionally hailing from noble or military families, Dune Captains are the core of any Dunefolk platoon. Usually a position filled based on heritage rather than merit, Captains are those who are often relatively weak with the blade, but still reasonably trained in tactics. Unlike other leaders, the Captainsâ€™ abilities lie largely in directing their troops to strategically advantageous positions rather than directly raising their morale. The presence of such a commander is rarely inspiring for most Soldiers, but they are still quick to follow the expert tactical direction of their officers."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_LEADERSHIP}

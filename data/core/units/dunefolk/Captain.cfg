    description= _ "Traditionally hailing from noble or military families, Dune Captains are the core of any Dunefolk platoon. Usually a position filled based on heritage rather than merit, Captains are those who are often relatively weak with the blade, but still reasonably trained in tactics. Unlike other leaders, the Captains’ abilities lie largely in directing their troops to strategically advantageous positions rather than directly raising their morale. The presence of such a commander is rarely inspiring for most Soldiers, but they are still quick to follow the expert tactical direction of their officers."

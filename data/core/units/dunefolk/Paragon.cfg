    description= _ "In many Dunefolk city-states, the process for selecting the next generation of leaders is a long process that takes place over many years. In each generation, a few particularly talented youths among the nobility are trained separately from their peers. Eat, sleep, and train, these warriors learn to live and breathe swordsmanship as their core identity more than even an extension of themselves. From adolescence, ten years of intense training paves the path to the final test, a series of duels to the death between pairs of these fighters. When the dust settles and the process is ended, eight are left remaining. These men are granted the title Kal, or collectively, Kalai.

Among the Dunefolk, while great leaders are required to have mastered the blade, the ruling caste is required to know far more than mere swordplay. Gruelling training is usually followed by either several years of nomadic roving through the deserts or dedication of the mind to the sciences, the purpose of which is to find a self-motivated path toward enlightened wisdom. No matter the case, at the end of the second training period, the remaining Kalai return and demonstrate their knowledge to the elders of the current ruling caste. Those who are found worthy are then called Paragon, warriors of great strength and acuity who may then be considered as candidates to lead the next generation of Dunefolk."

    description=_ "To the Dunefolk, the Wyvern is an image of untamable fear that may ravage its enemies, yet also a creature to be seen with great respect. The Wyvern is even the central piece of the united Dunefolk banner. The Dunefolk who manage to tame the Wyvern are few and far between, greatly revered among their kind as great heroes, even being passed on into legend. These riders devote their lives to the Wyvern, keeing whole packs of Wyverns in the mountains and hills near the desert. Yet even the riders may form strong bonds with the Wyverns, sometimes almost become a part of the pack.

Some Dunefolk leaders may hire these people for their courts to show their great power and wealth. These royal wyverns are rarely sent to battle, yet when they are it is usually to show one's power and incit fear in the enemy, demosntrating that your forces are strong enough to have tamed the Wyvern."

    description= _ "Among the Dunefolk armies, the highest prestige goes to the master swordsmen leading every assault. Though honored for their service in battle, those who wield the spear and shield are largely forgotten beyond that: the path of a spearman is to fulfill the least desirable role in combat without glory or recognition. When a Dunefolk assault fails and a retreat must be had, a rank of Spearguards is usually left behind to hold back the counterassault. Though providing a formidable defense, the shield line is inevitably overwhelmed and most of the Spearguards lost to the maw of war. On the off chance that one manages to survive and find his way back to the recuperating army, he is often reprimanded for failing to stand his ground and die with the rest of his unnamed brethren. Nevertheless, after a minor scolding, the warrior is accepted back and carries his hard won experience into the next battle.

It is not a formal title, but ‘Spearmaster’ is what Spearguards call their companions who manage to return from the usually suicidal defense that the Dunefolk mount to guard their retreats. Hardly a term of praise or distinction, it is still a modicum of recognition for those who were prepared to die as nameless martyrs to protect their brethren."

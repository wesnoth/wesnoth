    description= _ "Even in the absence of battle, infection and injury are common plights in the harsh desert sands. Dunefolk healers, in particular, require vast knowledge of herbs and medicine in comparison with healers of other races; the lack of magic combined with the meager plantlife in the desert results in great difficulty in treating the plethora of ailments and poisons that plague the dune peoples. Apothecaries are typically more knowledgeable and well-traveled compared to their less experienced brethren, but the title is usually applied to those who undertake the complex task of tending to valuable medicinal plants. The Dunefolk have no means of healing without the necessary materials, and thus Apothecaries possess a special role in supporting the remedial arts of their kind."

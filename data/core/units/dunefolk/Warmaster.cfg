    description= _ "In direct contrast with other Dunefolk commanders, Warmasters focus heavily on rousing their troops and maintaining high morale. These generals are often found at the forefront of battle, leading by example and fighting and bleeding alongside their soldiers. While Warmasters usually leave the finer details of strategy to their Captains, they are certainly capable tacticians as well; many a battle has been won on an inventive or surprise maneuver that is often the creative byproduct of combat experience rather than formal training. Said to be a veteran of a thousand battles, a Warmaster is an expert leader that should never be underestimated."{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_LEADERSHIP}

    description= _ "Dunefolk swordsmen are known for playing a game called the ‘Laeqad Challenge’, in which Laeqads—thick, sturdy reeds that are several sword-lengths in height—are hurled at them like javelins and they attempt to split the reed length-wise in midair. The trick to the game is that the reed is not circularly symmetric: most of the stalk is quite hard, but there is a thin line across the cross section that is softer and easier to cut. For even an experienced swordsman, splitting an entire Laeqad down its length would be an extraordinary achievement; most would be hard-pressed to cut even a single sword length, given the precise aim required to line up the blade with the reed’s soft spot. For a Blademaster, however, splitting several Laeqads in quick succession is quite ordinary, and some are even able to cut through two or three reeds simultaneously with a single sword swish.

This game has more practical implications in real battles. No matter how elusive or well-armored the fighter, against a Blademaster, it often seems like the defense does not even exist. These warriors are undoubtedly the masters of offensive swordsmanship and are capable of subverting even the strongest fortifications."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MARKSMAN}

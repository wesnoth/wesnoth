    description= _ "Archery on horseback presents a number of additional challenges that very few are able to overcome. What separates the renowned Windrider caste from other bowmen is their ability to not only master these difficulties, but turn them into benefits instead. Making great use of their steedsâ€™ incredible speed, a Windrider is actually a better archer when mounted as compared to on land. The extra momentum from riding on horseback provides additional force to their already potent shots, and by riding in meandering patterns, these bowmen are able to curve the trajectories of their arrows, reaching targets they might not be able to otherwise. Having honed their craft to its apex, Windriders are undisputed masters of ranged combat among the Dunefolk."

    description= _ "The push and pull of any battle requires varying degrees of offense and defense. The Dunefolk no doubt value offense as the greater of the two and focus their greatest efforts on training skilled swordsmen, but in any band of warriors, a small number of soldiers opt to trade in their sword and instead fulfill the vital duties of the Spearguard. Guarding crucial supply lines and vantage points, Spearguards are most often positioned slightly behind the main line and used as a supporting force or a deterrent to flanking attacks. Though these fighters tend to see less direct combat than their sword-wielding brethren, they are highly skilled with spear and shield and more than capable of repelling most advances."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_FIRSTSTRIKE}

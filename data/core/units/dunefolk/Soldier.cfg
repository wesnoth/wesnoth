    description= _ "While most Dunefolk castes serve an additional practical purpose beyond only direct warfare, cities and caravans usually train a group of soldiers completely dedicated to military purposes. By practicing intensely to hone their skills in swordplay, these warriors learn to navigate tricky fights in close quarters, mastering their enemies through melee combat. A typical Dunefolk formation makes use of this adeptness by placing soldiers in a spaced pattern, allowing them to assault and overwhelm clustered enemy lines by engaging them in quasi-single combat."

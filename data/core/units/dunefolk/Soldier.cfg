    description= _ "While most Dunefolk castes serve an additional practical purpose beyond only direct warfare, Dune Soldiers are among the few who are completely dedicated to military purposes. By train intensely to hone their skill in swordplay, Soldiers learn to navigate tricky fights in close quarters and repel ranged assaults with their shields. A typical Dunefolk formation makes use of this adeptness by placing Soldiers in a spaced pattern, allowing them to draw out clustered enemy lines and overwhelm their foes in pseudo single combat."

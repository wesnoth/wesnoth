    description= _ "The Arif form the backbone of any Dunefolk foot advance. Many come from noble or military families, and have spent most of their lives training their craft. Given their intense focus on swordplay, they are often sent against fortified enemy positions to create a breach for the remaining troops to exploit. The sight of Arif on the march, shields high, has caused many a defender to worry about the strength of their walls."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MARKSMAN}

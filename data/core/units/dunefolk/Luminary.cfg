    description= _ "On the surface, it is not entirely clear what distinguishes a Luminary from other healers among the Dunefolk. Certainly, a Luminary may be marginally more knowledgeable, well-traveled, or skilled in combat compared to Herbalists or Apothecaries, but the difference is usually modest at best. Nevertheless, ‘Luminary’ is a formal title granted to the highest order of Dunefolk healers and grants these men both the greatest esteem and the greatest envy.

There is some speculation that a secret order exists among the Luminaries. These so called ‘Eminents’ hoard a great deal of forbidden knowledge and advise many Dunefolk leaders from the shadows. Such a thing has never been proven, but the fact remains that some Luminaries seem to hold much more influence than their abilities should afford."

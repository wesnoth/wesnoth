    description= _ "Herbalists are learned individuals who have given up their urban life in order to assist the Dunefolk armies in their travels. Their motivations are many; some look to it as an adventure or as a steady source of pay, while others feel it to be a duty to their society. Regardless, Herbalists are highly respected by all. They are trained with the advanced medical techniques and possess a potent clutch of medicines and herbs, which allows them to quickly heal even the most gravely wounded allies."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_EXTRA_HEAL}

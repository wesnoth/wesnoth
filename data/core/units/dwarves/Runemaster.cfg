Striking blows nearly as powerful as those of the best warriors, they would be fearsome without their craft, but with it they are also nigh on invincible, since their runes cause the physical blows of their enemies to deal less damage than would be expected."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}

    description= _"Orcish Barges are crude constructions, devoid of any of the craftsmanship seen in almost any other ship. But what they lack in speed and grace, they make up for with their rugged durability and utility in navigating rivers and swamps. Their primary means of movement comes from a large, symmetric sail held at three points for downwind propulsion. When currents and winds lead to the wrong direction, the crew must use poles and anchors to move the barge in the intended direction.

Barges serve as transports for either supplies or troops, and when stocked with medicines can provide a safe space — akin to a village — for wounded fighters to rest. They lack any specific weaponry and cannot ram, but the crew is equipped with enough crude orcish bows to provide deterrent.

These barges are very ineffective in the high seas; little better than a floating wreck."

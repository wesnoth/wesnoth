    description= _ "Galleons are large and sturdy wooden ships used primarily for swift transport of goods across rivers and oceans in large quantities. The earliest Galleons were built long ago by ancient sailors from the Green Isle, before even the times of Haldric. Centuries later, their skillfully-crafted designs continue to be used by many Wesnothian sailors."

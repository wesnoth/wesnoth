    description= _ "What creatures manage to eke out a living in the inhospitable wastes find themselves inviolably changed. Rugged, well-armored, and known to grow to enormous sizes, the Horned Scarab is no less nimble on the shifting sands than its fair-weathered cousins are in the air. Lone travelers should especially be wary of their spiked horns. Though passive by nature, these insects will defend themselves with great ferocity, and few men alive would fain to face their penetrating barbs."

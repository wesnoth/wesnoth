    description= _ "Far from human cities in the great desert mountains, the large birds of prey known as Rocs can sometimes be found rapidly scouring the sands on their hunts. Despite their large size, Rocs tend to be reclusive and are only rarely encountered by other sapient races. Their elusive nature has raised them to near mythological status, particularly among the nomads of the deserts.

Unlike other avians, such as falcons or hawks, the individualistic and intelligent Rocs are nearly untamable. Only on occasion, a Roc may offer its aid to a traveler in need, usually in exchange for a small trinket or shiny bauble."

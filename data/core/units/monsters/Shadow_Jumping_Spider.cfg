    description= _ "Unlike the feared Giant Spider that uses poison and webs to catch prey, the Shadow Jumper relies on speed and the element of surprise. These stealthy, keen-eyed hunters creep to within striking distance, then pounce with a bite that is said to punch through steel. Once they have pierced their victim’s defenses, the spiders take what nourishment is available, feeding in a manner as fast and remorseless as befits their nature.

These giant jumping spiders often hunt in the same dark caverns as their web-weaving cousins, but they also prowl the forest canopy, ambushing hapless wanderers on the ground below. While they prefer the shadows, they are perfectly capable of hunting in the broad daylight."

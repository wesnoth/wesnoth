    description= _ "Giant Ants are common in almost any environment, from caverns deep under the earth to the tops of tall mountains. The queens are not royalty as many other races would understand, but they are the heart of any functioning nest and will be defended at all costs. As the nest core, they must be capable tacticians, and as a target of rival nests, they must also be deft warriors. The typical human or orc that finds an audience with an Ant Queen can expect a very short continued existence — and if their flesh is warm and nourishing, they can host an ant egg."

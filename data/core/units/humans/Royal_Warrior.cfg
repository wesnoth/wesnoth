    description= _ "The kings and princes of human nobility are still often trained rigorously in the combat arts, partly out of tradition from when their ancestors made their wealth in war. Fitted in armor so skillfully made as to incite envy even from some dwarvish smiths, these nobles are well conditioned to the art of moving in heavy armor, and can maneuver across the battlefield much faster than their gilded plate would suggest."

    description= _ "An experienced soldier will often save enough to equip himself with a suit of scale or chain armor, and a sturdy broadsword. Though trading their spears for swords can be a jarring change, most spearmen will leap at the chance, knowing all too well the limitations of the weapon they are leaving behind. A sword is not without its own drawbacks, but is more versatile than a spear, and much better in close quarters."

    description= _ "No one is quite sure how the practice of taming and riding wolves came into being, but the advantages of it for a goblin are obvious. Goblins are much smaller and weaker than their orcish kin and are often sent to the most dangerous and unwanted parts of a fight. Any who manage to tame a mount have a much safer role in combat.

Though few wolves could even stand with the weight of a true orc on their back, a goblin is quite within many wolvesâ€™ ability to carry swiftly. Unlike horses, these mounts have a rather easy time traversing the mountains, though water and woods will still slow them down."

These bastions are defended by the most determined of soldiers, who have often faced off against overwhelming odds only to repel the invaders. In an army they can be trusted to hold any position or line, long after lesser soldiers and men have fled in terror."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_FIRSTSTRIKE}

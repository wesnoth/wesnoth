# important note:
# While this unit is no longer used for clearing fog since r53779 meaning it's no longer used in mainline at all,
# it would be a bad idea to remove it, since addon multiplayer scenarios may rely heavily on it. (Due to the fact that the wesnoth
# engine does not transfer units over the network.) I know at least one addon (mine) which would be broken heavily, so
# PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!

# Use this unit to temporarily clear fog around a particular location.

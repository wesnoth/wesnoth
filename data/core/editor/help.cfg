To add named special locations, click “Add” at the bottom of the editor palette, and enter the name. These names must start with a letter and may contain numbers and underscores.

More than nine teams can be added to a map, by clicking “Add” and entering a number, for example “10”. The UI will automatically show this as “Player 10”.

Named locations can be accessed from WML using the Standard Location Filter’s <italic>text='location_id='</italic>. Player starts can also be accessed from WML using <italic>text='location_id=1'</italic>, <italic>text='location_id=2'</italic>, etc — use only the number, without adding “Player ” in front of the number.

    time zome assigned to them. The simplest way to adress a [time_aera] via scenario scripting is the `aera=` attribute in standard location filters.

This tool can be used to abstract between the implementation of an effect and the map specific setting.
This is a very powerful mechanism since it allows generic scenario codings working with different maps providing the needed named locations."

The editor is not a tool to help you scripting the scenario’s event handlers.

The editor can load most maps from older versions of Wesnoth, but not all. Maps from 1.3.2 and later will normally be supported, unless they use terrains which are no longer in mainline Wesnoth.

    title= _ "Wesnoth Map Format"
    text= _ "Wesnoth stores its maps in human readable plain text files." + "

" + _ <<<header>text='Native'</header>

A map file consists of rows with comma separated terrain code strings. The only non-terrain information provided by the map syntax are the locations created by the <ref>dst='editor_tool_starting' text='Starting Locations Tool'</ref>. The files can be edited with a general purpose text editor like notepad.

These files can be used directly for multiplayer games, the number of players is automatically determined by the number of starting positions. When saved in the default directory, the map can be found in the “Custom Maps” game type of the multiplayer “Create Game” dialog; you may need to refresh the cache (press F5 on the title screen) before a newly-created map appears.

These files can be used in a scenario’s .cfg file, with the scenario’s WML providing additional information such as teams, custom events, and complex side setups. The .cfg file loads the map file with either of:

• map_file=maps/01_First_Map.map <italic>text='— supported since Wesnoth 1.14'</italic>
• map_data="{maps/01_First_Map.map}" <italic>text='— a WML preprocessor include'</italic>

The <italic>text='map_file'</italic> method is preferred over using a preprocessor include.>> + "

" + _ <<<header>text='Embedded'</header>

The map data can stored as part of a scenario’s .cfg file, directly in the <italic>text='map_data'</italic> attribute. In other words, in the place that the preprocessor would include it when using the preprocessor-include method.

<bold>text='Using Embedded Format in Terrain Mode'</bold>

If you are editing the map and not using the Scenario Mode support, then it’s trivial to move the data to a native map file before opening it in the editor. This conversion is recommended — the editor supports editing the content of map_data while leaving everything else in the file untouched, but this is rarely-used code. Maps opened this way are marked (E) in the Window menu.>> + "

<b>Bluffs and Gulch</b>

The bluffs, gulches, and similar variations are much like a standard terrain overlay, and can simply be used that way. However, for larger areas of the map, where you will want to allow the use of other overlay terrains, you will want to combine these with the “markers” described in the next section.

        "</table>" +
        "To make a patch of terrain higher or lower, and still be able to use other overlay terrains such as trees, you will need to use these markers. Placing one of these arrows on the map will flood-fill the map with a color-coded haze; neither the haze nor the arrow will be visible in game. The hazed area will have a border ledge, making it look higher or lower than the adjacent tiles.

There are two high markers and two low markers, so it is possible to make terraces of up to five levels (lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest). Placing a high region next to a low region does not result in larger cliffs.
" + "
" +
        _ "
editor^<header>How to Use</header>

The marker arrows are not very useful by themselves, but the bluffs/gulch-type terrains can be used to contain the floodfilled area.

An example use case would be:
1.  Select the Bluffs (^Qhh) from the editor palette and use single-hex paint tool to outline a big blob over an empty, all-grass map.
2.  Place a Marker High (^_mh) arrow on a tile inside the blob (not on the Bluffs border).
3.  The blob should all be raised now, and as long as you don’t overwrite the Marker or Bluffs overlays, you can add other terrain overlays as needed.

The graphics used to represent the ledge borders are determined by the base terrain.

The <ref dst='..editor_mode_scenario'>Scenario Mode</ref>, in addition to the tools available in terrain mode, adds support for adding <ref dst='editor_tool_label'>labels</ref>, <ref dst='editor_tool_scenery'>scenery items</ref>, <ref dst='editor_tool_unit'>units</ref> in addition to the leader, and assigning <ref dst='editor_tool_village'>village ownership</ref> at the start of the scenario.

" + _ "In either mode, you will be prompted to choose an add-on to use for the scenarios you create. This can be an existing add-on or a brand new add-on. If you choose to use a brand new add-on, then the add-on will have all the required files and folders automatically created as well as a default ID assigned. Unless you are editing an already existing map file, using scenario mode is required in order for your maps to be selectable during game creation." + "

" + _ "<header>What you do *not* get</header>

• Exactly the same map rendering as in-game

The map won’t look exactly the same in the game as it does in the editor, because this depends on the terrain rules. For example, when many mountain hexes are clustered together the terrain rules will try to combine them into mountain ranges and large graphics spanning multiple hexes.

• Event handlers and scripting

The editor is not a tool to help you with scripting the scenario’s event handlers.

• Infinite Backwards Compatibility

The editor can load most maps from older versions of Wesnoth, but not all. Maps from 1.3.2 and later will normally be supported, unless they use terrains which are no longer in mainline Wesnoth. Maps from add-ons which have their own terrains will need that add-on to tell the editor about their terrains."

    id=editor_map_format
    title= _ "Wesnoth Map Format"
    text= _ "Wesnoth stores its maps in human readable plain text files." + "

" + _ "<header>Native</header>

A map file consists of rows with comma-separated terrain code strings. The only non-terrain information provided by the map syntax is the set of locations created by the <ref dst='editor_tool_starting'>Starting Locations Tool</ref>. The files can be edited with a general purpose text editor.

These files can be used directly for multiplayer games, the number of players is automatically determined by the number of starting positions. When saved in the default directory, the map can be found in the “Custom Maps” game type of the multiplayer “Create Game” dialog; you may need to refresh the cache (press F5 on the title screen) before a newly-created map appears.

These files can be used in a scenario’s .cfg file, with the scenario’s WML providing additional information such as teams, custom events, and complex side setups. The .cfg file loads the map file with either of:

• <span face='monospace'>map_file=maps/01_First_Map.map</span> <italic>— supported since Wesnoth 1.14</italic>
• <span face='monospace'>map_data=&quot;&#0x7B;maps/01_First_Map.map&#0x7D;&quot;</span> <italic>— a WML preprocessor include</italic>

The <italic>map_file</italic> method is preferred over using a preprocessor include." + "

" + _ "<header>Embedded</header>

The map data can be stored as part of a scenario’s .cfg file, directly in the <italic>map_data</italic> attribute. In other words, in the place that the preprocessor would include it when using the preprocessor-include method.

<header>Using Embedded Format in Terrain Mode</header>

If you are editing the map and not using the Scenario Mode support, then it’s trivial to move the data to a native map file before opening it in the editor. This conversion is recommended — the editor supports editing the content of map_data while leaving everything else in the file untouched, but this is rarely-used code. Maps opened this way are marked (E) in the Window menu." + "

" + _ "<header>Files created by the Scenario Editor</header>

In scenario mode, the editor saves the scenario data as a .cfg file and the map data as a separate .map file. The scenario then references the .map file via map_file. When loading a .cfg file, the scenario editor understands files created by the scenario editor itself, but is likely to have difficulty with files that have been edited by hand; problems can be avoided by <ref dst='editor_separate_events_file'>using a separate .cfg file</ref> for the hand-edited parts."

Multiple scenarios that follow on from each other, telling a story, make up <italic>text='campaigns'</italic>. In a campaign, you often need to play more carefully, preserving your best troops for use again in later scenarios.

The interactive tutorial campaign <bold>text='The South Guard'</bold> introduces Wesnoth gameplay in the context of a campaign. Most material covered in the tutorial is explained in these pages, so you can always refer back here if you forget something.

After you master the basics, be sure to try another novice campaign next! You can help two brothers overcome a deadly peril in <italic>text='A Tale of Two Brothers'</italic>, help the prince Konrad through a turning point in the history of Wesnoth in the epic <italic>text='Heir to the Throne'</italic> or guide the mage Delfador on his way to becoming a legend in the equally epic <italic>text='The Deceiver’s Gambit'</italic>. A full list of installed campaigns can be found via the <bold>text='Campaign'</bold> option on the main menu, which is full of equally interesting adventures in the long history of Wesnoth. We’d recommend playing them in the order they are listed, but feel free to skip any that’s not your cup of tea!

Campaigns are grouped by <italic>text='level'</italic> and <italic>text='difficulty'</italic>. For example, <italic>text='Heir to the Throne'</italic> is ‘Novice’ level, and is playable at three difficulties: ‘Beginner’, ‘Normal’, and ‘Challenging’. The level of a campaign indicates what degree of proficiency in the game mechanics (such as <ref>dst='movement' text='zones of control'</ref> and <ref>dst='time_of_day' text='time of day'</ref>) is assumed. The difficulty indicates how challenging the scenarios will be: at higher difficulties, the obstacles to victory will be higher and overcoming them will require more skillful play. For example, at higher difficulties the enemy may have higher incomes, higher-level units, more castle hexes, and so on." + "

There are two aspects to this; <italic>text='income'</italic> and <italic>text='upkeep'</italic>." + _ "

Income is simple. You have a base income of 2 gold per turn. For every village you control, you gain one additional gold each turn. Thus, if you have ten villages, you would normally gain 12 gold each turn. Your upkeep costs are subtracted from this income, as detailed below." + "

<img>src=help/income-upkeep1.png align=middle box=no</img><br/>" + _ "
Upkeep is also fairly simple. Each unit requires an amount of Upkeep equal to its level. You can support as many levels worth of units as you have villages, without paying any upkeep. However, for each level of unit beyond the number of villages you have, you must pay one gold per turn. For example, if you have twelve level one units and ten villages, you would have to pay two gold each turn in upkeep." + _ "

Upkeep costs are subtracted from your income, so in the case of twelve levels of units and ten villages, your resultant Income would be 10 gold per turn." + "

<img>src=help/income-upkeep2.png align=middle box=no</img><br/>" + _ "
In general, the base income, the amount of gold you get per village per turn, and the number of unit levels each village can support are configurable, but in campaigns they are almost always the values described above.

There are two important exceptions to upkeep: units with the loyal trait and leaders never incur upkeep.

Units have a certain amount of experience required to advance (this is 20% less for units with the Intelligent trait). Once they achieve this amount, they immediately advance to the next level, healing fully in the process. In some cases, you will be given a choice of advancement options." + _ "

While most units have three levels, not all do. Occasional units (such as <ref>dst='unit_Mage' text='magi'</ref>) may have four. Once a unit has reached its maximum level, it may have an <italic>text='After Maximum Level Advancement'</italic> (AMLA) available to it. The AMLA will modify the unit each time the unit reaches the experience goal, but the unit will remain the same level. The typical AMLA effect is for the unit to raise the maximum HP by 3 and full-heal it. The first AMLA will normally be reached with 150 XP gained (120 XP for intelligent units). However, gaining an AMLA becomes progressively harder for each AMLA the unit receives, and so it is usually more useful to try to advance your lower level units."

Click on the unit you wish to move to select it, then click on the hex you wish to move it to. When a unit is selected, everywhere it can move this turn will be highlighted, and all other hexes on the map are made dull. Mousing over a highlighted hex shows the defense rating the unit would have if you moved it to that hex. Mousing over a dull hex will also show the number of turns required to reach it, and clicking will cause the unit to move towards it by the fastest route over this and subsequent turns. If you don’t use up all of a unit’s movement when you first move a unit, you may move it again. This is useful when having two units switch places. Attacking with a unit will use up its movement. Ending a move in a village you don’t already own will also use up a unit’s movement, but will still allow it to attack." + _ "

Each unit has a certain number of movement points which are used up when moving into a new hex, depending on the Terrain of that particular hex. For instance, grassland nearly always costs 1 movement point to enter. Exactly how many movement points are spent entering a hex depends on the unit type — in forest, elvish units only spend 1 movement point, most human and orc units spend 2, while horsemen spend 3. You can learn how many movement points a unit requires to enter a certain terrain type by right-clicking on it, selecting <bold>text='Unit Description'</bold>, and then looking at <bold>text='Terrain Modifiers'</bold>." + _ "

Another thing to keep in mind while moving is <italic>text='zones of control'</italic>. Each unit — except for level 0 units — generates a zone of control in the hexes immediately surrounding it, and any enemy unit entering those hexes immediately ends its movement. Learning how to use zones of control to your advantage is an important part of Wesnoth, as only <ref>dst='ability_skirmisherskirmisher' text='skirmishers'</ref> can ignore zones of control." + _ "

To see where the enemy can move to during their next turn, press Ctrl-v or Cmd-v. Ctrl-b or Cmd-b shows where the enemy could move, if your units were not on the map to block their progress."

Normally you can undo a unit’s movement, as long as an event with a randomized result has not occurred, such as combat or recruitment (as most units receive random traits when recruited). Exploring hidden terrain by clearing shroud or fog will also prevent undos to a previous state. You may wish to activate <bold>text='Delay Shroud Updates'</bold> in the actions menu.

        title= _ "Learning from Losses"
        text= _ "<italic>text='Why did I lose that scenario?'</italic>

One of the most difficult parts of Wesnoth is understanding why a scenario was lost." + _ "

When you first start playing, you will probably lose some scenarios. That is normal, and is part of learning the game. When that happens, try to learn from your mistakes: watch the replay, try to understand what you did wrong, then <ref>dst='saveload' text='restart the scenario'</ref> and try again." + _ "

Some common reasons for losing a scenario are:" + _ "

• Playing a campaign at too high a <ref>dst='..gameplay' text='difficulty level'</ref>. Try restarting the scenario at an easier difficulty." + _ "

• Playing a poor strategy: for example, recruiting the wrong types of units, fighting at the wrong <ref>dst='time_of_day' text='time of day'</ref>, not taking advantage of terrain features or units’ special abilities, and so on." + _ "

• Missing clues. Often there will be hints in the campaign’s story and dialog about what to expect from a difficult scenario and how to prepare for it. If you have a loyal mage on your side, take the time to listen to its advice; it may save your life." + _ "

• Barely scraping a victory in a previous scenario. Campaigns generally assume that you will have some <italic>text='carryover gold'</italic> and some experienced units on your <italic>text='recall list.'</italic> (These concepts are explained in the tutorial.) If you win a scenario but lose most of your experienced units and much of your gold, the following scenario may be very difficult to beat, even for a more experienced player. If you find yourself in this situation, you may try to go back a scenario or two and win them more convincingly, or change to an easier difficulty. (However, remember that <italic>text='some'</italic> losses are expected, particularly at higher difficulties.)" + _ "

• Poor gold management. At higher difficulties, managing gold — capturing villages to increase the income, and using low-level units and fresh recruits to reduce the spending — becomes important. If you use many high-level units, you might win a scenario easily but have not enough gold carryover for the next scenario. (This would be an example of “barely scraping a victory”.)" + _ "

<header>text='Unlikely reasons'</header>" + _ "

In addition to the common reasons, listed above, there are a few other reasons which are unlikely, though not impossible. They are:" + _ "

• You may have played a strategy that the campaign developer did not anticipate, and ended up with a set of high-level units not suitable for the next scenario." + _ "

• You may have found a scenario that can only be won on the second or third time through, whether by requiring above-average luck or by expecting the players to have foreknowledge — to know what surprises are coming up before they happen. (It is under discussion whether foreknowledge is expected at the highest difficulties. Requiring above-average luck, however, would qualify as a bug.)" + _ "

• Unusually-bad luck. Whether an attack hits or misses is random, so it could happen that the enemy was very lucky and had many hits, while you were very unlucky and had many misses. However, this is a very rare occurrence, virtually unheard of in all but the shortest, smallest scenarios. In fact, losses are more commonly caused by playing a <italic>text='bad'</italic> strategy despite having <italic>text='above-average'</italic> luck, than by playing a <italic>text='good'</italic> strategy but having <italic>text='below-average'</italic> luck. Moreover, merely having “below-average” luck does not excuse a loss; having below-average luck is perfectly normal, and scenarios are designed to be winnable even with below-average luck. It is only exceedingly bad luck, over multiple turns, that we mean here." + _ "

Be wary of attributing a loss to any of these reasons. If you are not a veteran player, it is far more likely that your loss was caused by one of the <italic>text='common'</italic> errors, listed above, and is not indicative of a bug in the campaign. However, if you still think you found a bug, then by all means, report it!" + _ "

The “Damage Calculations” dialog shows some statistics that can help determine whether a match was very lucky or very unlucky. However, reading the statistics is no substitute to watching the replay and looking for strategic mistakes, or small bits of luck at critical points in the engagement."

Click on your unit, and click on the enemy you want to attack: your unit will move towards the enemy unit, and when they are next to each other, combat will begin. The attacker and defender alternate strikes until each has used their allotted number of strikes. The attacker chooses one of its weapons to attack with, and the defender retaliates with one of its attacks of the same type. There are two types of attacks: <italic>text='melee'</italic>, which usually involves weapons such as swords, axes or fangs; and <italic>text='ranged'</italic>, which usually involves weapons such as bows, spears and fireballs." + _ "

<header>text='Order and Number of Strikes'</header>" + _ "

The attacker gets the first strike, then the defender retaliates. Each strike either hits, doing a given amount of damage, or misses, doing no damage at all. Strikes alternate until each unit has used up all of its strikes. The number of strikes a unit has varies; for instance, an elvish fighter with a 5×4 attack may strike 4 times, each successful strike dealing 5 damage, while an orcish grunt with a 9×2 attack can only strike twice (but at 9 damage for each hit)." + _ "

<header>text='Chance to Hit'</header>" + _ "

Every unit has a chance of being hit, based on the <italic>text='terrain'</italic> it is in. This is shown in the status pane, and may also be found by right-clicking a unit, selecting <bold>text='Unit Description'</bold>, and then looking at <bold>text='Terrain Modifiers'</bold>. For instance, many elves have a defense rating of 70% in forest, so a unit attacking them has only a 30% chance of hitting. Conversely, the elf’s chance of hitting the attacker in return depends on what terrain the attacker is in." + _ "

There are two exceptions to this rule: <ref>dst='weaponspecial_magical' text='magical attacks'</ref> and <ref>dst='weaponspecial_marksman' text='marksmen'</ref>. Magical attacks always have a 70% chance to hit, regardless of terrain, and, when used offensively, marksmen always have at least a 60% chance to hit, regardless of terrain." + _ "

<header>text=Damage</header>" + _ "

Each strike which hits causes a base amount of damage depending on the attack type. For instance, an elvish fighter with a 5×4 attack does 5 base damage. This is usually modified by two things: <ref>dst='damage_types_and_resistance' text='resistance'</ref> and <ref>dst='time_of_day' text='time of day'</ref>. To see how base damage is modified by the circumstances, select <bold>text='Damage Calculations'</bold> in the attack selection menu." + _ "

A few units have special <ref>dst='..abilities_section' text='abilities'</ref> which affect damage dealt in combat. The most common of these is <ref>dst='weaponspecial_charge' text='charge'</ref>, which doubles the damage dealt by both attacker and defender when the unit with charge attacks."

Different units may have resistances which alter the damage which they take from certain damage types." + _ "

Resistances work very simply: if a unit has 40% resistance against a damage type, then it will suffer 40% less damage when hit with that damage type. It is also possible for a unit to be vulnerable against some damage types. If a unit has −100% resistance against a damage type, it will suffer 100% more damage when hit by that type." + _ "

For example, skeletons are highly resistant to blade and pierce damage, but are vulnerable to impact and fire damage, and extremely vulnerable to arcane damage." + _ "

If a strike is determined to hit, it will always do at least 1 point of damage. This applies even if the defender has 100% resistance to the damage type."

Terrains come in two types: <italic>basic</italic> and <italic>mixed</italic>." + _ "

<header>Basic Terrain Types</header>" + _ "

Basic terrain types include Flat, Hills, Mountains, Sands, Water and Swamps. There are many more besides these — a list of the terrain types you have discovered can be found at the end of this page.

" + "<img src='terrain/grass/green.png'/>" + "<img src='terrain/hills/regular.png'/>" + "<img src='terrain/mountains/dry-tile.png'/>" + "<img src='terrain/sand/desert.png'/>" + "<img src='terrain/water/coast-tile.png'/>" + "<img src='terrain/swamp/water-tile.png'/><br/>" + _ "Every unit has a defense rating and a movement cost for each of the basic terrain types, and these values are listed in the unit’s help page.

<header>Mixed Terrain Types</header>" + _ "

Mixed terrain types share the properties of multiple basic terrain types — units generally receive the <italic>best defense</italic> and <italic>worst movement</italic> of the underlying basic types when they move onto a mixed type. For example, this is the case with <italic>forested hills</italic>, <italic>sand hills</italic>, and <italic>cave hills</italic>.

Fords are easily passable to both merfolk and humans — all units moving on a ford enjoy the best defense and best movement out of flat and shallow water, rather than the worse movement of the two. Similarly, bridges over chasms are passable to nonfliers (unsurprisingly).

Instead, they count only as water tiles.

" + "<img src='terrain/water/coast-tile.png~BLIT(terrain/village/coast-tile.png)'/><br/>" + _ "You can see what basic types a mixed terrain is comprised of by mousing over its hex and checking the terrain type icons displayed in the upper right (under the default theme)." + _ "

You can see what type of behavior the mixed terrain gives by mousing over its hex and viewing the <italic>terrain description</italic> by either pressing the hotkey, or right clicking and selecting from the context menu." + _ "

<header>Defense Caps</header>" + _ "

Some units have <italic>defense caps</italic> for a particular basic terrain type. These units suffer a penalty on mixed terrains with that type — their defense cannot exceed the cap." + _ "

For example, the <ref dst='unit_Cavalryman'>Loyalist Cavalryman</ref> has a defense rating of 30% on forests, and a defense cap for forests. Thus, on forested hills, he has a defense rating of 30% rather than 40%, because the mixed rating cannot exceed the cap." + _ "

If a unit has a defense cap for some terrain, it is always the same as its defense rating on that terrain (it cannot be larger)." + _ "

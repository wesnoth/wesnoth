<italic>text='Battle for Wesnoth'</italic> is a turn-based fantasy strategy game somewhat unusual among modern strategy games. While other games strive for complexity, <italic>text='Battle for Wesnoth'</italic> strives for simplicity of both rules and gameplay. This does not make the game simple, however — from these simple rules arise a wealth of strategy, making the game easy to learn but a challenge to master.

The following pages outline all you need to know to play Wesnoth. As you play, new information is added to the various categories as you come across new aspects of the game. For more detailed information on special situations and exceptions, follow the included links."

Each of these battles is called a <italic>text='scenario'</italic>, which can be strung together to make <italic>text='campaigns'</italic>. Besides the campaigns that ship with the game, Wesnoth supports user-made content, and the add-on server boasts hundreds of custom maps, campaigns, eras, factions, and resources.

The game also features a human-readable markup called Wesnoth Markup Language (WML) to easily allow users to create their own content, as well as a fully-featured Map and Scenario Editor for designing your own battlefields.

The <italic>text='Battle for Wesnoth'</italic> project was begun in 2003, and has been worked on by a multitude of volunteers ever since."

There are two aspects to this; <italic>text='income'</italic> and <italic>text='upkeep'</italic>." + _ "

Income is simple. You have a base income of 2 gold per turn. For every village you control, you gain one additional gold each turn. (In general this is configurable but in campaigns it is almost always one gold per village.) Thus, if you have ten villages, you would normally gain 12 gold each turn. Your upkeep costs are subtracted from this income, as detailed below." + _ "

Upkeep is also fairly simple. Each unit requires an amount of Upkeep equal to its level. You can support as many levels worth of units as you have villages, without paying any upkeep. However, for each level of unit beyond the number of villages you have, you must pay one gold per turn. For example, if you have twelve level one units and ten villages, you would have to pay two gold each turn in upkeep." + _ "

Upkeep costs are subtracted from your income, so in the case of twelve levels of units and ten villages, your resultant Income would be 10 gold per turn." + _ "

There are two important exceptions to upkeep: units with the loyal trait and leaders never incur upkeep. Units you begin the scenario with (such as Delfador), or units who join you during a scenario (such as the horseman in the second scenario of <italic>text='Heir to the Throne'</italic>) will usually have the <italic>text='loyal'</italic> trait.

Units have a certain amount of experience required to advance (this is 20% less for units with the Intelligent trait). Once they achieve this amount, they immediately advance to the next level, healing fully in the process. In some cases, you will be given a choice of advancement options." + _ "

While most units have three levels, not all do. Occasional units (such as <ref>dst='unit_Mage' text='magi'</ref>) may have four. Once a unit has reached its maximum level, it may have an <italic>text='After Maximum Level Advancement'</italic> (AMLA) available to it. The AMLA will modify the unit each time the unit reaches the experience goal, but the unit will remain the same level. The typical AMLA effect is for the unit to raise the maximum HP by 3 and full-heal it. The first AMLA will normally be reached with 150 XP gained (120 XP for intelligent units). However, gaining an AMLA becomes progressively harder for each AMLA the unit receives, and so it is usually more useful to try to advance your lower level units."

Click on the unit you wish to move to select it, then click on the hex you wish to move it to. When a unit is selected, everywhere it can move this turn will be highlighted, and all other hexes on the map are made dull. Mousing over a highlighted hex shows the defense rating the unit would have if you moved it to that hex. Mousing over a dull hex will also show the number of turns required to reach it, and clicking will cause the unit to move towards it by the fastest route over this and subsequent turns. If you don’t use up all of a unit’s movement when you first move a unit, you may move it again. This is useful when having two units switch places. Attacking with a unit will use up its movement. Ending a move in a village you don’t already own will also use up a unit’s movement, but will still allow it to attack." + _ "

Each unit has a certain number of movement points which are used up when moving into a new hex, depending on the Terrain of that particular hex. For instance, grassland nearly always costs 1 movement point to enter. Exactly how many movement points are spent entering a hex depends on the unit type — in forest, elvish units only spend 1 movement point, most human and orc units spend 2, while horsemen spend 3. You can learn how many movement points a unit requires to enter a certain terrain type by right-clicking on it, selecting <bold>text='Unit Description'</bold>, and then looking at <bold>text='Terrain Modifiers'</bold>." + _ "

Another thing to keep in mind while moving is <italic>text='zones of control'</italic>. Each unit generates a zone of control in the hexes immediately surrounding it, and any enemy unit entering those hexes immediately ends its movement. Learning how to use zones of control to your advantage is an important part of Wesnoth, as only <ref>dst='ability_skirmisher' text='skirmishers'</ref> can ignore zones of control." + _ "

To see where the enemy can move to during their next turn, press Ctrl-v or Cmd-v. Ctrl-b or Cmd-b shows where the enemy could move, if your units were not on the map to block their progress."

The <italic>text='fog of war'</italic> only hides units and ownership of villages (other than by you or your allies). The fog of war is cleared temporarily when you have units nearby, but returns when they leave. Both the shroud and the fog of war are cleared by units.

Normally you can undo a unit’s movement, as long as an event with a randomized result has not occurred, such as combat or recruitment (as most units receive random traits when recruited). Exploring hidden terrain by clearing shroud or fog will also prevent undos to a previous state. You may wish to activate <bold>text='Delay Shroud Updates'</bold> in the actions menu.

        text= _ "Combat in <italic>text='Battle for Wesnoth'</italic> always takes place between units in adjacent hexes. Click on your unit, and click on the enemy you want to attack: your unit will move towards the enemy unit, and when they are next to each other, combat will begin. The attacker and defender alternate strikes until each has used their allotted number of strikes. The attacker chooses one of its weapons to attack with, and the defender retaliates with one of its attacks of the same type. There are two types of attacks: <italic>text='melee'</italic>, which usually involves weapons such as swords, axes or fangs; and <italic>text='ranged'</italic>, which usually involves weapons such as bows, spears and fireballs." + _ "

<header>text='Order and Number of Strikes'</header>" + _ "

The attacker gets the first strike, then the defender retaliates. Each strike either hits, doing a given amount of damage, or misses, doing no damage at all. Strikes alternate until each unit has used up all of its strikes. The number of strikes a unit has varies; for instance, an elvish fighter with a 5–4 attack may strike 4 times, each successful strike dealing 5 damage, while an orcish grunt with a 9–2 attack can only strike twice (but at 9 damage for each hit)." + _ "

<header>text='Chance to Hit'</header>" + _ "

Every unit has a chance of being hit, based on the <italic>text='terrain'</italic> it is in. This is shown in the status pane, and may also be found by right-clicking a unit, selecting <bold>text='Unit Description'</bold>, and then looking at <bold>text='Terrain Modifiers'</bold>. For instance, many elves have a defense rating of 70% in forest, so a unit attacking them has only a 30% chance of hitting. Conversely, the elf’s chance of hitting the attacker in return depends on what terrain the attacker is in." + _ "

There are two exceptions to this rule: <ref>dst='weaponspecial_magical' text='magical attacks'</ref> and <ref>dst='weaponspecial_marksman' text='marksmen'</ref>. Magical attacks always have a 70% chance to hit, regardless of terrain, and, when used offensively, marksmen always have at least a 60% chance to hit, regardless of terrain." + _ "

<header>text=Damage</header>" + _ "

Each strike which hits causes a base amount of damage depending on the attack type. For instance, an elvish fighter with a 5–4 attack does 5 base damage. This is usually modified by two things: <ref>dst='damage_types_and_resistance' text='resistance'</ref> and <ref>dst='time_of_day' text='time of day'</ref>. To see how base damage is modified by the circumstances, select <bold>text='Damage Calculations'</bold> in the attack selection menu." + _ "

A few units have special <ref>dst='..abilities_section' text='abilities'</ref> which affect damage dealt in combat. The most common of these is <ref>dst='weaponspecial_charge' text='charge'</ref>, which doubles the damage dealt by both attacker and defender when the unit with charge attacks."

Additionally, there are three further types of damage usually associated with magical attacks: <italic>text='fire, cold, and arcane attacks'</italic>. Different units may have resistances which alter the damage which they take from certain damage types." + _ "

Resistances work very simply: if a unit has 40% resistance against a damage type, then it will suffer 40% less damage when hit with that damage type. It is also possible for a unit to be vulnerable against some damage types. If a unit has −100% resistance against a damage type, it will suffer 100% more damage when hit by that type." + _ "

For example, skeletons are highly resistant to blade and pierce damage, but are vulnerable to impact and fire damage, and extremely vulnerable to arcane damage." + _ "

If a strike is determined to hit, it will always do at least 1 point of damage. This applies even if the defender has 100% resistance to the damage type."

<italic>text='Curing units'</italic>: Units with the <ref>dst='ability_cures' text='cures'</ref> ability will cure Poison in all allied adjacent units (in preference to healing, if it has that ability as well)." + _ "

Resting can be combined with other forms of healing, but villages, regeneration, healing and curing cannot combine with each other: the best option will be used. Finally, units heal fully between scenarios."

Quick is the most noticeable trait, particularly in slower moving units such as trolls or heavy infantry.

        title= _ "Terrains"
        text= _ "Game maps feature a variety of terrains that affect both unit movement and a unit’s defensive capability in combat." + _ "

Terrains come in two types: <italic>text='basic'</italic> and <italic>text='mixed'</italic>." + _ "

<header>text='Basic Terrain Types'</header>" + _ "

Basic terrain types include Flat, Hills, Mountains, Sands, Water and Swamps. There are many more besides these — a list of the terrain types you have discovered can be found at the end of this page.

" + "<img>src='terrain/grass/green.png'</img>" + "<img>src='terrain/hills/regular.png'</img>" + "<img>src='terrain/mountains/dry-tile.png'</img>" + "<img>src='terrain/sand/desert.png'</img>" + "<img>src='terrain/water/coast-tile.png'</img>" + "<img>src='terrain/swamp/water-tile.png'</img>" + _ "

Every unit has a defense rating and a movement cost for each of the basic terrain types, and these values are listed in the unit’s help page. Basic terrain types may have unique properties like illumination effects as well." + _ "

<header>text='Mixed Terrain Types'</header>" + _ "

Mixed terrain types share the properties of multiple basic terrain types — units generally receive the <italic>text='best defense'</italic> and <italic>text='worst movement'</italic> of the underlying basic types when they move onto a mixed type. For example, this is the case with <italic>text='forested hills'</italic>, <italic>text='sand hills'</italic>, and <italic>text='cave hills'</italic>.

" + "<img>src='terrain/hills/regular.png~BLIT(terrain/forest/pine-tile.png)'</img>" + "<img>src='terrain/hills/desert.png'</img>" + "<img>src='terrain/cave/hills-variation.png'</img>" + _ "

One notable exception is bridge terrains, such as <italic>text='bridges over shallow water'</italic>, <italic>text='fords'</italic>, and <italic>text='bridges over chasms'</italic>. Fords are easily passable to both merfolk and humans — all units moving on a ford enjoy the best defense and best movement out of flat and shallow water, rather than the worse movement of the two. Similarly, bridges over chasms are passable to nonfliers (unsurprisingly).

" + "<img>src='terrain/water/coast-tile.png~BLIT(terrain/bridge/wood-se-nw.png)'</img>" + "<img>src='terrain/water/ford-tile.png'</img>" + "<img>src='terrain/chasm/regular-tile.png~BLIT(terrain/cave/chasm-stone-bridge-sw-ne-tile.png)'</img>" + _ "

Land-based villages generally give the best defense and movement as well. These villages are mixed terrains, based on the village terrain type, together with hill, swamp, and cave, respectively.

" + "<img>src='terrain/hills/regular.png~BLIT(terrain/village/human-hills-tile.png)'</img>" + "<img>src='terrain/swamp/water-tile.png~BLIT(terrain/village/swampwater-tile.png)'</img>" + "<img>src='terrain/cave/floor6.png~BLIT(terrain/village/cave-tile.png)'</img>" + _ "

Finally, water villages are generally inhospitable to land units, and do not give defense or movement benefits associated with the village terrain type. Instead, they count only as water tiles.

" + "<img>src='terrain/water/coast-tile.png~BLIT(terrain/village/coast-tile.png)'</img>" + _ "

You can see what basic types a mixed terrain is comprised of by mousing over its hex and checking the terrain type icons displayed in the upper right, (under the default theme)." + _ "

You can see what type of behavior the mixed terrain gives by mousing over its hex and viewing the <italic>text='terrain description'</italic> by either pressing the hotkey, or right clicking and selecting from the context menu." + _ "

<header>text='Defense Caps'</header>" + _ "

Some units have <italic>text='defense caps'</italic> for a particular basic terrain type. These units suffer a penalty on mixed terrains with that type — their defense cannot exceed the cap." + _ "

For example, the <ref>text='Loyalist Cavalryman' dst='unit_Cavalryman'</ref> has a defense rating of 30% on forests, and a defense cap for forests. Thus, on forested hills, he has a defense rating of 30% rather than 40%, because the mixed rating cannot exceed the cap." + _ "

If a unit has a defense cap for some terrain, it is always the same as its defense rating on that terrain (it cannot be larger)." + _ "

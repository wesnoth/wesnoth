Battle for Wesnoth is a turn-based fantasy strategy game somewhat unusual among modern strategy games. While other games strive for complexity, Battle for Wesnoth strives for simplicity of both rules and gameplay. This does not make the game simple, however - from these simple rules arise a wealth of strategy, making the game easy to learn but a challenge to master."

To begin with, it's best to click the <italic>text=Tutorial</italic> button at the main menu. This will take you to the interactive tutorial, which will teach you the basics of Wesnoth. After this, it is recommended that you play the Heir to the Throne campaign first - click <italic>text=Campaign</italic> then <italic>text='Heir to the Throne'</italic>.

        text=_"The game takes place over a series of battles, called scenarios. Each scenario pits your troops against the troops of one or more adversaries. You can play against the computer, or with friends who each take turns sitting at the computer (hotseat play). If your computer is connected to a computer network, you can also play against other people connected to that network. If your computer has a connection to the Internet, you can play against other people across the Internet." + _"

Each scenario has some objectives, shown as the scenario starts. These objectives list what you need to do to win, and what you should do to avoid losing. Often the objective is to defeat all enemies, but other times you need to reach a destination, to rescue someone, to solve a puzzle, or just to survive a certain number of turns." + _"

Campaigns consist of multiple scenarios that follow on from each other, telling a story. In a campaign, you often need to play more carefully, preserving your best troops so that they can be used again in later scenarios in the campaign."

Click on the unit you wish to move to select it, then click on the hex you wish to move it to. When a unit is selected, everywhere it can move this turn will be highlighted, and all other hexes on the map are made dull. Mousing over a highlighted hex shows the defense rating the unit would have if you moved it to that hex. Mousing over a dull hex will also show the number of turns required to reach it, and clicking will cause the unit to move towards it by the fastest route over this and subsequent turns. If you don't use up all of a unit's movement when you first move a unit, you may move it again. This is useful when having two units switch places. Attacking with a unit will use up its movement. Ending a move in a village you don't already own will also use up a unit's movement, but will still allow it to attack." + _"

Each unit has a certain number of movement points which are used up when moving into a new hex, depending on the Terrain of that particular hex. For instance, grassland nearly always costs 1 movement point to enter. Exactly how many movement points are spent entering a hex depends on the unit type - in forest, elvish units only spend 1 movement point, most human and orc units spend 2, while horsemen spend 3. You can learn how many movement points a unit requires to enter a certain terrain type by right-clicking on it, selecting Unit Description, and then looking at <italic>text='Terrain Modifiers'</italic>." + _"

Another thing to keep in mind while moving is Zones of Control. Each unit generates a zone of control in the hexes immediately surrounding it, and any enemy unit entering those hexes immediately ends its movement. Learning how to use zones of control to your advantage is an important part of Wesnoth, as only <ref>dst=ability_skirmisher text='Skirmishers'</ref> can ignore zones of control." + _"

To see where the enemy can move to during their next turn, press Ctrl-v or Cmd-v. Ctrl-b or Cmd-b shows where the enemy could move, if your units were not on the map to block their progress."

The Shroud hides both the terrain and any units at a location. However, once it is cleared, you can always see that location. The Fog of War only hides units and ownership of villages (other than by you or your allies). The Fog of War is cleared temporarily when you have units nearby, but returns when they leave. Both the Shroud and the Fog of War are cleared by units. Each unit clears locations adjacent to those within one turn's move (ignoring zones of control and enemy units).

Normaly you can undo a unit's movement, as long as an event with a randomized result has not occurred, such as combat or a recuritment. Exploring hidden terrain by clearing Shroud or Fog will also prevent undos to a previous state. You may wish to activate 'delay shroud updates' in the actions menu. This will prevent units from clearing Shroud or Fog until the next randomized event or a manual update via 'update shroud now' (or the end of your turn) and thereby perserve your ability to undo movement."

        title= _ "Combat"
        text= _ "Combat in Battle for Wesnoth always takes place between units in adjacent hexes. Click on your unit, and click on the enemy you want to attack: your unit will move towards the enemy unit, and when they are next to each other, combat will begin. The attacker and defender alternate strikes until each has used their allotted number of strikes. The attacker chooses one of its weapons to attack with, and the defender retaliates with one of its attacks of the same type. There are two types of attacks: melee, which usually involves weapons such as swords, axes or fangs; and ranged, which usually involves weapons such as bows, spears and fireballs." + _"

<header>text='Order and number of strikes'</header>" + _"

The attacker gets the first strike, then the defender retaliates. Each strike either hits, doing a given amount of damage, or misses, doing no damage at all. Strikes alternate until each unit has used up all of its strikes. The number of strikes a unit has varies; for instance, an Elvish fighter with a 5-4 attack may strike 4 times, each successful strike dealing 5 damage, while an Orcish Grunt with a 9-2 attack can only strike twice (but at 9 damage for each hit)." + _"

<header>text='Chance to hit'</header>" + _"

Every unit has a chance of being hit, based on the Terrain it is in. This is shown in the status pane, and may also be found by right-clicking a unit, selecting Unit Description, and then looking at <italic>text='Terrain Modifiers'</italic>. For instance, many elves have a defense rating of 70% in forest, so a unit attacking them has only a 30% chance of hitting. Conversely, the elf's chance of hitting the attacker in return depends on what terrain the attacker is in." + _"

There are two exceptions to this rule: <ref>dst=weaponspecial_magical text='Magical attacks'</ref> and <ref>dst=weaponspecial_marksman text=Marksmen</ref>. Magical attacks always have a 70% chance to hit, regardless of terrain, and, when used offensively, Marksmen always have at least a 60% chance to hit, regardless of terrain." + _"

<header>text=Damage</header>" + _"

Each strike which hits causes a base amount of damage depending on the attack type. For instance, an Elvish Fighter with a 5-4 attack does 5 base damage. This is usually modified by two things: <ref>dst=damage_types_and_resistance text=Resistance</ref> and <ref>dst=time_of_day text='Time of Day'</ref>. To see how base damage is modified by the circumstances, select <italic>text='Damage Calculations'</italic> in the attack selection menu." + _"

A few units have special <ref>dst=abilities text=abilities</ref> which affect damage dealt in combat. The most common of these is <ref>dst=weaponspecial_charge text=Charge</ref>, which doubles the damage dealt by both attacker and defender when the unit with Charge attacks."

Additionally, there are three further types of damage usually associated with magical attacks: Fire, Cold and Arcane attacks. Different units may have resistances which alter the damage which they take from certain damage types." + _"

Resistances work very simply: if a unit has 40% resistance against a damage type, then it will suffer 40% less damage when hit with that damage type. It is also possible for a unit to be vulnerable against some damage types. If a unit has -100% resistance against a damage type, it will suffer 100% more damage when hit by that type." + _"

For example, Skeletons are highly resistant to Blade and Pierce damage, but are vulnerable to Impact and Fire damage, and extremely vulnerable to Arcane damage." + _"

If a strike is determined to hit, it will always do at least 1 point of damage. This applies even if the defender has 100% resistance to the damage type."

If a unit kills another in combat, however, it gains much more experience - 4 for a level 0 unit, 8 for level 1, 16 for level 2, 24 for level 3, and so forth." + _"

Units have a certain amount of experience required to advance (this is 20% less for units with the Intelligent trait). Once they achieve this amount, they immediately advance to the next level, healing fully in the process. In some cases, you will be given a choice of advancement options." + _"

While most units have three levels, not all do. Occasional units (such as <ref>dst=unit_Mage text=Magi</ref>) may have four. Once a unit has reached its maximum level, it may have an After Maximum Level Advancement (AMLA) available to it. The AMLA will modify the unit each time the unit reaches the experience goal, but the unit will remain the same level. The typical AMLA effect is for the unit to raise the maximum HP by 3.  The first AMLA will normally be reached with 100 XP gained (80 XP for intelligent units).  However, gaining an AMLA becomes progressively harder for each AMLA the unit receives, and so it is often more useful to try to advance your lower level units.

Note that only a small number of units, for example the Necrophage, will actually heal with AMLA effects. Most units just gain the bonus to the Maximum HP."

Income is simple. You have a base income of 2 gold per turn. For every village you control, you gain one additional gold each turn. Thus, if you have ten villages, you would normally gain 12 gold each turn. Your Upkeep costs are subtracted from this income, as detailed below." + _"

Upkeep is also fairly simple. Each unit requires an amount of Upkeep equal to its level. You can support as many levels <italic>text=worth</italic> of units as you have villages, without paying any upkeep. However, for each level of unit beyond the number of villages you have, you must pay one gold per turn. For example, if you have twelve level one units and ten villages, you would have to pay two gold each turn in upkeep." + _"

Upkeep costs are subtracted from your Income, so in the case of twelve levels of units and ten villages, your resultant Income would be 10 gold per turn." + _"
There are two important exceptions to Upkeep: units with the Loyal trait and leaders never incur upkeep. Units you begin the scenario with (such as Delfador), or units who join you during a scenario (such as the Horseman in the second scenario of Heir to the Throne) will usually have the Loyal trait. The unit you are playing (such as Konrad) will almost always be a leader."

Intelligent units are very useful at the beginning of a campaign as they can advance to higher levels more quickly.

Quick is the most noticeable trait, particularly in slower moving units such as trolls or heavy infantry. Units with the Quick trait often have greatly increased mobility in rough terrain, which can be important to consider when deploying your forces. Also, Quick units aren't quite as tough as units without this trait and are subsequently less good at holding contested positions."

Resilient units can be useful at all stages of a campaign, and this is a useful trait for all units. Resilient is often most helpful as a trait when it occurs in a unit that has some combination of low hitpoints, good defense, or high resistances. Resilient units are especially useful for holding strategic positions against opponents."

During campaigns, certain units may opt to join the player's forces of their own volition. These units are marked with the Loyal trait. Although they may require payment to be recalled, they never incur any upkeep costs. This can make them invaluable during a long campaign, when gold is in short supply.

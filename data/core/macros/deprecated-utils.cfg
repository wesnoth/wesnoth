#define ON_SIGHTING ID SIGHTING_SIDE SIGHTED_FILTER ACTION_WML
    #deprecated 2 Use an [event]name=sighted instead.
    # NOTE: As of version 1.11, this macro is unnecessary, since sighted
    # events now work as intended.
    #
    # This is intended to be used when a regular sighted event can't be relied
    # on (that'd be most of the time). This event triggers when a unit matching
    # SIGHTED_FILTER is first seen by a unit of side SIGHTING_SIDE. This works
    # whether the sighting happens due to moving, recruiting, recalling,
    # attacking (in case DSU was on before the attack) or advancing. If none of
    # those actions manage to "catch" the moment of sighting, then it will occur
    # when the current side ends their turn.
    #
    # The 'unit' and 'second_unit' message speaker shortcuts as well as the
    # auto-stored $unit and $second_unit should work normally: the sighting unit
    # is the primary unit and the sighted unit is the secondary unit.
    #
    # You need to provide a unique ID if you use several of these events in the
    # same scenario. Otherwise it can be left empty.
    #
    # Only works if SIGHTING_SIDE has fog and/or shroud.
    #
    # Example:
    #! {ON_SIGHTING () 1 side=2,3 (
    #!     [message]
    #!         speaker=unit

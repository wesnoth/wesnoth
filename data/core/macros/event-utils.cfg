# This file contains shortcuts for common WML events (such as prestart, side
# turn, and such), which can be used to write events faster and in less space.
#
# It is recommended that you only use these if you're confident you could write
# the expanded form as well; these are mostly intended as shortcuts for
# experienced WML authors.

# These don't depend on any other macros.  Please don't change this.
# ! in comments is used in generating HTML documentation, ignore it otherwise.

#define CALL_FUNCTION EVENT_NAME PARAMETER_WML
    # This will fire an event with a set of parameters, for example:
    #! {CALL_FUNCTION my_event a,b,c=1,2,3}
    #
    # That example would fire an event with name "my_event"
    # and inside that event, $param.c will be equal to "3"
    # This will hold true even if the event is fired recursively

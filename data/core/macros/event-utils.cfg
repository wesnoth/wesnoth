# This file contains shortcuts for common WML events (such as prestart, side
# turn, and such), which can be used to write events faster and in less space.
#
# It is recommended that you only use these if you're confident you could write
# the expanded form as well; these are mostly intended as shortcuts for
# experienced WML authors.

# These don't depend on any other macros.  Please don't change this.
# ! in comments is used in generating HTML documentation, ignore it otherwise.

#define CALL_FUNCTION EVENT_NAME PARAMETER_WML
    # This will fire an event with a set of parameters, for example:
    #! {CALL_FUNCTION my_event a,b,c=1,2,3}
    #
    # That example would fire an event with name "my_event"
    # and inside that event, $param.c will be equal to "3"
    # This will hold true even if the event is fired recursively

#define ON_SIGHTING ID SIGHTING_SIDE SIGHTED_FILTER ACTION_WML
    # This is intended to be used when a regular sighted event can't be relied
    # on (that'd be most of the time). This event triggers when a unit matching
    # SIGHTED_FILTER is first seen by a unit of side SIGHTING_SIDE. This works
    # whether the sighting happens due to moving, recruiting, recalling,
    # attacking (in case DSU was on before the attack) or advancing. If none of
    # those actions manage to "catch" the moment of sighting, then it will occur
    # when the current side ends their turn.
    #
    # The 'unit' and 'second_unit' message speaker shortcuts as well as the
    # auto-stored $unit and $second_unit should work normally: the sighting unit
    # is the primary unit and the sighted unit is the secondary unit.
    #
    # You need to provide a unique ID if you use several of these events in the
    # same scenario. Otherwise it can be left empty.
    #
    # Only works if SIGHTING_SIDE has fog and/or shroud.
    #
    # Example:
    #! {ON_SIGHTING () 1 side=2,3 (
    #!     [message]
    #!         speaker=unit
    #!         message= _ "I can see a side $second_unit.side $second_unit.language_name|!"
    #!     [/message]
    #!     [message]
    #!         speaker=second_unit
    #!         message= _ "Oh my! I was seen by a side $unit.side $unit.language_name|!"
    #!     [/message]

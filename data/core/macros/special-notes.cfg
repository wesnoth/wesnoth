# The SPECIAL_NOTES macro and ability-specific SPECIAL_NOTES_* macros are deprecated, they are strings that were historically included directly in [unit_type]description.
# Since 1.16 these special notes are found in the abilities, movetypes and weapon specials themselves.
#
# The INTERNAL:SPECIAL_NOTES_* macros contain the strings shared by the deprecated macros and the non-deprecated uses. They aren't intended to be reused outside mainline.

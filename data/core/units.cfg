#define RACIAL_NOTES_ORCS_AND_GOBLINS
_ "Despite orcs’ reliance on raw strength, few of their children are destined to grow to possess any. Goblins are, despite their appearance, born as siblings to the orcs and members of the same race. While other races usually bear children singly or in pairs, orcs will have large litters of children all at once, causing their populations to explode. Within any litter, there will be only one or two who grow to the strength of a “true orc”, a few who are born slightly smaller and weaker, and the rest, often a full half of any litter, are much weaker and destined to be goblins. Almost as newborns the class system of orcish society is visible, with the weak put in their place by their stronger siblings. The stronger ones will routinely grab most of the food and thus grow stronger still, while their weaker siblings do not."#enddef

        plural_name= _ "race^Drakes"
        description= _"Drakes are large, winged and fire-breathing creatures, reminiscent of true dragons. On average, an adult drake stands around three meters tall and easily weighs more than a man and a horse combined. Their skin is made up of hard scales, resistant to most physical strikes except piercing and cold damage. Most drakes are capable of true flight and can travel long distances quickly. However, their sheer weight and bulk limits their flight ability somewhat, making them ungainly in the air. Where possible, they make use of terrain features such as hills, mountains and trees as launch points in order to gain greater height and speed. Fortunately for their enemies, their large size renders them easy targets for those who dare attack them.

Drakes are inherently magical creatures, with a mysterious internal fire fueling their very lives. This can easily be witnessed when one of their kind perishes in combat; its internal fire is released, burning their remains into ashes. Their internal fire is also their greatest weakness; it makes them extremely vulnerable to cold attacks. Despite their magical nature, drakes are incapable of channeling magic in a controlled manner. While the magic imbued within a drake’s body enables it to spit fire and gives it life, they have no willful control over the functions of this magic.

<header>text='Society'</header>
Drakes are a relatively warlike race and their societies can be best described as cultured martial societies. The core of a drake tribe is a small group of veteran warriors headed by a mutually respected — or simply feared — dominant who rules the society with an iron fist. Every drake is expected to earn their place in the strict hierarchy, to obey their superiors and command their inferiors. Entry to the ruling elite is only possible through challenging and defeating a superior in single combat, which is the way the hierarchy within the elite itself is established. The use of deception of any kind towards any fellow drake is, without exception, seen as cowardly and unacceptable.

While their warlike nature and sense of territory drives them to defend their territories savagely, drakes rarely invade or trespass on areas already occupied by the other major races. Instead, they settle in unpopulated areas to establish their own territory there. They primarily feed on large game they hunt in the lowlands around their homes, but hatchlings and lower caste drakes are known to feed also on certain kinds of moss and fungi they cultivate deep in their caverns. Drakes value armor- and weapon-smithing, but neither know nor need other science and culture besides this. Nonetheless, the few implements they do fashion are almost unrivaled in quality, only matched by those produced in the finest Dwarvish foundries.

Drakes hatch from eggs and may live naturally for several decades, although some have been known to survive for longer. However, death in battle is the most preferred way for a drake to leave this world. As such, most drakes do not live to see the end of their natural lifespan.

<header>text='Geography'</header>
Drakes originated from an archipelago of volcanic islands called <ref>dst='morogor' text='Morogor'</ref> in the <ref>dst='great_ocean' text='Great Ocean'</ref>. A combination of population pressure and the subsidence of many of their home islands has caused colonies of drakes to spread to the <ref>dst='great_continent' text='Great Continent'</ref>. Drakes tend to make their homes in mountain caverns near volcanoes to protect their eggs, hatchings and forges. While drakes naturally prefer warmth, their internal fire is more than capable of sustaining them even in a relatively cold climate, a feature which has allowed them to populate even some of the mountains of the far north of the Great Continent."

        description= _"The dwarves are a race famed for their miners, blacksmiths, merchants and warriors. Considered as the third oldest race on the great continent after the elves and trolls, their early history is shrouded in mystery. Legends tell of a time long forgotten when their people began emerging from their underground world through caves. Nothing is known about their life prior to their arrival, or their reasons for entering the surface world, but they have been an integral part of the history of the continent since. Soon after their emergence from the underground, the dwarves entered into conflict with the original inhabitants of the land, the elves. The original reason for their dispute has been lost to history, but the two races have since fought three long wars, interrupted by a few decades of peace. During these wars the dwarves could not dislodge the elves from the deep forests in the south, but managed to consolidate their position in hills and the mountains in the north of the continent, known now as the Northlands. Since then they have constructed fantastic fortifications and settlements deep within the mountains and crags of their territory.

Possibly due to their isolation, the dwarves are generally distrustful or hostile towards most other races, particularly the elves. The single exception to this temperament is towards humans. This could be traced back to the era of Haldric I and the arrival of humans and orcs to the continent. At this point the dwarves began allowing some humans, mostly dissidents and outlaws from the Kingdom of Wesnoth, to settle in certain areas of the Northlands. Their motivation was unsurprising. The plight of these individuals reminded the dwarves of their early history of persecution, eliciting a sense of solidarity. The dwarves also had much to gain in forming a bond with these outcasts. They would settle in areas where dwarves disliked living themselves; plains, forests, and swamps, freeing them from defending these areas.

Dwarves are of small stature by human measure, but they are by no means fragile. Their warriors, tough and powerful are both feared and respected throughout the continent for their prowess in battle. In addition, dwarves are known for their calculating intellects and superb craftsmanship. Dwarven smiths are renowned for their deadly weapons and heavy armor. These accouterments are unrivaled in quality, possibly only matched by those produced by drake armorers. Their intelligence and natural inquisitiveness has also made them the most technically advanced race on the continent. One of their most famous, and feared, discoveries was a mysterious powder that produces an immense explosion when exposed to fire or sparks. Certain dwarf warriors use this powder to hurl small objects at tremendous speeds. Given their technological inclinations, many dwarves tend to distrust magic users. However, some practice a form of magic based on the engraving of runes. Called runesmiths, they use these carvings to enchant items in order to augment certain aspects of their natures."

        description= _"Compared to humans, elves are somewhat taller, more agile but less sturdy. They have slightly pointy ears, pale skin and usually blond hair. Few differences between humans and elves are more pronounced than the Elves’ unusually long life — most, unless claimed by illness, accident or war, live at least a full two centuries. While some elves possessing a high magical aptitude have been known to live longer, most elves begin to grow physically frail at some point between 250 and 300 years of age and pass away rapidly thereafter.

Most elves share an intense affection for unspoiled nature and find themselves uncomfortable in open, unvegetated places. They live primarily in the forests of the Great Continent, the Aethenwood in the southwest, Wesmere in the northwest, and the great northern woods of which the Lintanir Forest is the southernmost edge.

Elves are among the eldest races of the continent. Many of their settlements cannot be reliably dated, undoubtedly having existed for several millennia.

<header>text='Magic'</header>
While elves are fundamentally different creatures than the fabled fair folk, their magic has some connection to the faerie and is the source of their unusually keen senses as well as their long lives. Elven magic is split between two different paths, one focused on manipulation of the mundane or natural world, and one focused on divination into the arcane plane. More common is the the way of corporeal alteration, which has more tangible effects than its antithesis in the arcane. Though elven nature magic is ill-suited toward combat, its potent ability to harness earthly energies to nurture and protect is the primary reason for the effectiveness of elven healing as well as the beauty and vitality of their forests.

Those who follow the mystic path are also well-regarded by other elves, but their motives and abilities are often unclear to those outside of their order. Some who venture far down the path of mysticism take on more faerie-like traits, gaining extraordinary insight and longevity, but also becoming sensitive to and even burned by the presence of cold iron.

<header>text='Culture'</header>
Elves spend much of their time honing their talents and skills. Those not adept at the magical arts typically devote their time honing their physical skills, often for sporting purposes. As a result, elves excel at archery, a craft that is readily and effectively applied to warfare. Elves are also renowned musicians, particularly skilled at wind and plucked string instruments in small ensembles. The Aeolian harps of the Aethenwood, for example, are crafted from the fine wood of Elven yew trees and are legendary for their soft, gentle tone.

<header>text='Society'</header>
Elvish society is roughly divided into three factions: a pseudo-military faction responsible for defending their forests, peaceful civilians who are usually craftsmen and artists, and healers and mystics who maintain the elves’ connection to the faerie. Responsible for governing these different aspects is the nobility, who are treated as servants to the broader social order, rather than as strict rulers of their people. The process for selecting these nobles differs between the various elven conclaves, with the governing council of Wesmere — the Ka’lian — being elected and the nobility in Lintanir usually being inherited.

In times of strife, the hierarchy of command becomes more adaptable, with the ordinary aristocracy deferring to more war-minded marshals. By tradition, in both Wesmere and Lintanir, an enchantress from the order of elven mystics is also called upon to facilitate the transition of power."

Although they originally came from the Old Continent, men have spread all over the world and split into many different cultures and races. Although they are not imbued with magic like other creatures, humans can learn to wield it and are able to learn more types than most others. They have no extra special abilities or aptitudes except their versatility and drive. While often at odds with other races, they can occasionally form alliances with the less aggressive races such as elves and dwarves. The less scrupulous among them do not shrink back from hiring orcish mercenaries, either. They have no natural enemies, although the majority of men, like most people of all races, have an instinctive dislike of the undead. Men are shorter than the elves, but taller still than dwarves. Their skin color can vary, from almost white to dark brown.

<header>text='Subjects of the Crown'</header>
Many different groups of men exist, but the majority of them on the Great Continent live under the rule of the Crown of Wesnoth. The humans first appeared on the Great Continent from a land far across the ocean to the West, the Green Isle, and soon established their capital at the inland city of Weldyn. Over the following centuries they have built up a number cities across the continent. The soldiers from the Crown of Wesnoth protect the country, forming the most organized military force in the known world. Its warriors come from the main provinces, where all men are conscripted at an early age.

<header>text='The Clansmen'</header>
The eastern provinces of Wesnoth, known as the Clan Homelands, have a geography consisting of more open plains and rolling hills than the western, more civilized provinces. They are home to the Horse Clans, who are allied with the Crown of Wesnoth but operate independently and maintain their own identity. Some consider them to be a tributary state, which sends food and soldiers to Crown in exchange for protection. Others say they are on equal footing with the western half of Wesnoth. In any case, the eastern provinces do not have a conscript army the way Western Wesnoth does. Training for fighting is part of the way of life of the Clans; the parents teach the children to ride horses, fight and shoot a bow from an early age. In general, the Clan warriors are less organized than the civilized fighters, and the strengths and weaknesses of these groups complement each other."

        help_taxonomy=human
        description= _"An offshoot of a forgotten nomadic civilization, the Dunefolk lay claim to the river valleys and oases of the Sandy Wastes. How they came to inhabit this far corner of the Great Continent is unknown. Their legends tell of many long and perilous travels through far-flung lands, but the true origin of their people is a topic of endless and heated debate among even the most erudite of their scholars.

Whatever their origin, the Dunefolk have thrived. Bustling cities stand proudly in the largest fertile regions. Skilled artisans, fine smiths, and wealthy merchants form the backbone of the urban economy. Each of these cities also enjoys a degree of independence less common in the more centralized nations to the north, many even maintaining their own standing armies. In times of need, however, each and all rally to a higher authority designated to protect the superior interest of the nation.

Those who have not settled in these urban centers still adhere to the lifestyle of their ancestors, roaming the dunes and leading their herds from one watering hole to another. They are most active during the early hours of dawn and the onset of dusk, when the wastelands are neither too hot nor too cold. Their skill at moving through the sands is excellent even by Dunefolk standards. Although sometimes regarded with contempt by their city counterparts, they provide an invaluable service as mobile, light troops in war, or as escorts for trading caravans during times of peace.

The Dunefolk’s inclination towards trade and exploration has allowed their cities to amass immense fortunes, a fact regarded both with admiration and envy by other races. Mutual interests have fostered cordial relations with neighboring Naga tribes, but more secretive races such as Drakes and Elves have always considered Dunefolk expeditions to be too intrusive, especially when they venture close to territorial boundaries. It is not uncommon for caravans to fall prey to troll ambushes in the mountains, something that has given rise to countless tales of unimaginable treasure amassed in hidden caves.

As a result of living in hostile environments for centuries, the Dunefolk have developed rational methods of enquiry through which they continue to improve their understanding of the world. Their study of herbal medicine keeps their warriors and workers fresh and healthy. Their knowledge of alchemy allows them to tame fire and wield it as a deadly weapon in battle. At the same time, this analytical mindset has distanced them from magical arts; to the rational mind, magic is uncontrollable, unpredictable, and hence unreliable. For this reason, the Dunefolk especially loathe the perversions of necromancy and the dark arts, even more so than other races.

The Dunefolk’s inquisitive and explorative nature does not preclude military strength. Not only do they field nimble light troops, cataphracts, and heavily armored infantry, but their keen knowledge of technology grants them a decisive advantage over their opponents. When facing the Dunefolk in battle, however, the most fearsome sight is certainly their deployment of ferocious and bizarre beasts. From the majestic Roc to the imposing Wyvern, their synergy with these creatures allows for great versatility in combat. The origins of this tradition likely lie in the heritage of the Dunefolk’s distant past in the exotic far corners of Irdya."

        description= _ "Saurians are lizard-like creatures. Smaller and more slender than humans, they rarely stand taller than a ten year old child, though from tip of snout to end of tail a Saurian can be as long as the average man is tall. Light and nimble, the warriors prefer to fight as they hunt — slipping through enemy lines to target the weak and the injured while evading their attackers.

<header>text='Society'</header>
Saurians are very mysterious creatures due to their tendency to live in areas inhospitable to others, such as swamps. Fatalistic in the extreme, Saurians believe all the events in a life can be predicted by the use of a complex form of astrology.

Saurian culture is sharply segregated between the genders. Within each gender the members compete, and through skill, determination, and reputation establish a clear pecking order, with a chief at the top. On those occasions when the two genders interact they do not contest for dominance; instead, the situation determines the dominant gender. The chief of the males is alpha within the clan’s village or encampment while the chief of females is dominant anywhere else. This continues down the rank structure with each male or female being dominant over any member of the opposite gender with lower rank and submitting to members of the opposite gender with higher rank.

The segregation and alternating gender-dominance of Saurian society is an outgrowth of their clearly defined gender roles. It is the responsibility of the female to hunt and find food, skills which ultimately train them to be warriors: the skirmishers, flankers, and ambushers other races so fear. Males, meanwhile, are responsible for guarding the clutch — the eggs left by the females. While this leaves time for the males to develop and hone the arts of astrology, healing, and magic, it also exposes them to significant danger, as they are stationary targets for a Saurian clan’s number one enemy — other Saurian clans.

New Saurian clans are started when the proper astrological signs are read. Called a “hatching,” each female indicated by the conjunction selects a group of individuals with lower rank and leave their source clan. Frequently all females with a specific trait will be indicated, causing multiple clans to “hatch” at the same time. Selection is a simple process: no group leaving can be larger than any other, all the groups together cannot be larger than the group being left, and higher ranking allows a female to overrule another female’s choice of who they take.

Because of their rapid population growth, frequent splits in clans, and the fact that cannibalism is not taboo, violence is one of the defining features of Saurian life. This limits the growth of the Saurian culture to fits and starts, as much of their knowledge is passed by oral tradition and their possessions must be mobile.

<header>text='Geography'</header>
Saurians can live in many different areas, though swamps are by far their most common habitat.

<header>text='Biology'</header>
Saurians live spectacularly short lives by comparison to most of the other races of Wesnoth, reaching full adulthood within three years and often dying by the time they are 10 to 15 years old. By far, the most common cause of death is violence. Saurian females produce clutches of about 20 eggs roughly once a year, which creates constant population pressure and would stress most carnivores’ food supply. Hunters and scavengers, Saurians have extremely strong jaws and have a very powerful digestive system with highly acidic fluids, making them capable of eating and digesting all of their prey including skin, teeth, horns and bones. Further, they have no aversion to eating carrion and even committing cannibalism, which are both regular occurrences."

Their blood is darker and thicker than that of humans, and they have little care for personal hygiene or their personal appearance. Although Orcs are violent even among themselves, they are pack-oriented; an orc never travels alone or lives in groups smaller than half a dozen.

<header>text='Society'</header>
Almost every orc is a member of a tribe or a clan. Relations between neighboring tribes are usually violent, except in cases of a mutual enemy threatens their existence or prospects of great plunder override mutual animosity. Occasionally, a single strong chieftain may emerge to lead multiple tribes from time to time, usually through intimidation of followers. An orc tribe in times of peace tends to focus almost solely on strengthening itself in preparation for the next armed conflict. Orcs are known to possess a crude system of writing — usually in blood — although it’s most commonly used to trade insults or threats among tribal leaders.

Orc societies are based on little else but strength; might makes right, and a leader leads and survives only as long as no one manages to wrest the title from him. A constant struggle for power simmers among potential tribal chiefs. An orcish leader rarely lives more than a handful of years to enjoy his absolute authority before being killed for his position — although history knows some notable exceptions. Orcs hold no particular honor code and while indisputable raw strength is usually the preferred method of displaying power, assassination, poisoning and backstabbing are completely viable means to further one’s own goals.

Orcs mostly live in rural areas, often in foothills or mountainous regions, sometimes in caves. They grow no crops nor keep livestock, but are competent hunters as a result of their physical stature and brutality. Due to their large numbers they are capable of hunting an area virtually clean of anything larger than rodents in relatively short period of time. Due to this and their unstable leadership, orcish tribes tend to lead a semi-nomadic lifestyle, never settling in one region for too long. The larger tribes may establish themselves firmly in an area for years or even decades and build large encampments almost resembling cities, but even these are easily dismantled and abandoned if there is a need to relocate the horde.

The oldest known orcs have been around 50 to 60 years of age, but very few individuals ever live to see over two or three decades before meeting their end either in war or by the hand of one of their kin. The oldest orcs are often shamans, which are perhaps the only ones most of their kind sees as being trustworthy and neutral. The origins of this custom are unknown, as the shamans do not directly contribute much to orcish societies but only act as advisors — not something orcs tend to otherwise tolerate. Shamans are in many ways the opposite of most other orcs: they are often physically withered and frail in comparison and lack skill in battle.

In the aftermath of a battle, the dead and wounded are a banquet for ravens, thus ravens are a nuisance for allies of the defeated but are seen by some victors as part of martial ceremonies. The violence and large numbers that characterize both orcs and humans bring these races into constant interaction with ravens in this context. For this reason, the birds have become characters in fables, parables, and superstitions related to war.

As intelligent scavengers, ravens do not need war dead to survive. Some farmers struggle to keep ravens away from freshly sown seeds, but others are happy to have them around as sentries."

        description= _"Trolls are ancient creatures, one of the oldest known races known to inhabit the Great Continent. They are large, slow, simple, and live extremely long lives inside deep caves or atop high mountains. The most unique characteristic of trolls is an internal vitality that sustains and heals them from within. As a result they live very different lives from almost any known creature. Trolls have few real needs: they require little food or water, and thus they have little incentive to pursue much besides protection from those who are hostile towards them. This in turn means they rarely have to worry about anything and can spend much of their time sleeping or in contemplation. Trolls have a curious affinity with nature. They do not relate with living things like elves do, but instead with earth and stone. They are also somewhat curious of their surroundings and many younger whelps even enjoy traveling and seeing the world. As trolls grow older they tend to become increasingly passive, gradually losing interest in their environment and spending more of their time sleeping in a quiet, familiar corner of their home cave. This is until they finally pass away as their bodies themselves slowly turn into lifeless statues of stone.

Trolls are seen by many as being little more than yet another race of savage monsters. This common misconception is in part perpetuated by orcish successes in persuading trolls to join their armies. Because they are rather simple and do not understand the ways of other races or sometimes cannot even tell them apart, it is usually easy for an orcish band to convince a group of trolls that by joining them they get to exact revenge on those that have before hunted them. These new recruits are then directed to attack whoever the orcs themselves are currently in conflict with, whether previously a foe of the trolls or not, accumulating even more enemies for the misled trolls. The most common enemy of trolls are dwarves, and the animosity between these two races is ancient.

Trolls have inhabited the mountains of the Great Continent longer than the dwarves who migrated there. Trolls are a common sight on the mountain ranges north and east of Wesnoth, and wherever Orcish hordes travel."

        description= _"Undead are not really a single race of creatures, although often treated as such. Most ordinary creatures can, by a sufficiently skilled necromancer, be reanimated into constructs of varying character — resurrection of the physical form often results in a minion that obeys its master without question, while manifestation of a soul usually produces a servant with at least a modicum of thought. A great mystery of necromancy is how these constructs are sustained and controlled without continuous effort from the necromancer. Most dark magi do not provide constant attention or maintenance to their creations, instead allowing them a small degree of independence to function autonomously in line with the provided commands. However, when left unchecked, some undead gain enough sovereignty to break free from and even turn on their masters. Accordingly, while even lesser undead require periodic maintenance, this is especially true for more powerful undead, particularly greater spirits or death knights, who possess a high degree of inherent will. In these cases, necromancy becomes a battle of resolve between mage and minion. The necromancer must maintain a delicate balance between control over their servants and allotting them free will — the source of their individual powers.

Necromancy is almost solely limited to humans. Even the legends of magically apt races like elves and merfolk tell of very few of their kind who have ever delved in the dark arts. It is surmised that necromantic magic requires great adaptability and a flexible mind, extremes of which are most commonly found in humans. The ultimate goal of most necromancers is to turn the same art of preserving and imbuing life upon themselves, to alter themselves at whatever cost, to ultimately escape death by preserving their own mind and spirit.

As guardians of the forest, the woses share a connection to the woodlands deeper than even the elves’. While the woses are a peaceful race, disturbance of the ancient forests, which they tend, will incite the wrath of nature itself. Woses are slow moving creatures that may spend centuries standing in one location undisturbed by the ebb and flow of time.

Although they practice no magic of their own, the woses share a deep connection to faerie. What little is known of this ancient race comes from elvish scholars who believe that this mystical power, which the mightiest elves have dedicated their lives to master, is inherent to the wose. Though woses resemble them, they share no ancestry with trees. Woses are believed to be some of the oldest creatures in the world, perhaps even more ancient than the forests in which they dwell, and it is thought that the power of faerie has given these beings the eternal task of serving as wardens of the forest.

Woses are not warlike in the least and are ill-accustomed to combat. They will however respond with indiscriminate violence in defense of their forested territory. Woses are slow moving and are vulnerable away from the woodlands. Due to their close connection with faerie, woses are particularly sensitive to the arcane. The hardwood that makes the wose nigh-impervious to physical assault has left it grievously vulnerable to flame. Their thick bark and ability to harness the power of faerie to regenerate quickly when injured allows the wose to survive an enemy onslaught long enough to respond with a crushing might belied by its peaceful, plodding nature. Within its forest home, the wose can disappear amongst the trees and ambush even the best-trained elvish scout.

The life span of the wose is unknown, although the most ancient members of this race have lived many hundreds of years and have grown to massive heights. It is thought that unless a wose falls in battle, it will find no natural end. Content to pass the centuries standing like a sentry, uninterested in the goings-on of the civilized world, the wose will stir only to march to the defense of the natural world and the forests it calls home."

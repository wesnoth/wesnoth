The <b>Undead</b> are a faction of <ref dst='..race_undead'>undead</ref> creatures and <ref dst='..race_human'>human</ref> practitioners of dark arts that usually accompany them. Often, these “Dark Adepts” are the units that do the most damage for the faction, but they have a major vulnerability — their practicing of this forbidden, evil magic has consumed all their energy and so they have no melee attack at all. The Undead are a very aggressive faction and the most powerful <ref dst='..era_era_default'>Default Era</ref> faction at nighttime."

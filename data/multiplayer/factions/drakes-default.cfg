" + _ "The <b>Drakes</b> are a faction of dragon-like <ref dst='..race_drake'>Drakes</ref> and their lizard <ref dst='..race_lizard'>Saurian</ref> allies. Drakes are descendants of dragons, but smaller in size. Saurians are considerably smaller than Drakes and from different ancestry. Together, the Drake faction has high mobility but low defense, leading to unusual tactics for a <ref dst='..era_era_default'>Default Era</ref> faction."

The <b>Northerners</b> are a faction of <ref dst='..race_orc'>Orcs</ref> and their allies who live in the north of the Great Continent, thus their name. Northerners consist of the warrior orcs race, the enslaved <ref dst='..race_goblin'>goblins</ref>, <ref dst='..race_troll'>trolls</ref> who are tricked into combat by the orcs, and the serpentine <ref dst='..race_naga'>naga</ref>. The Northerners play best by taking advantage of having many low-cost and high HP soldiers."

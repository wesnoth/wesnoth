"+_"The <bold>text='Northerners'</bold> are a faction of <ref>text='Orcs' dst='..race_orc'</ref> and their allies who live in the north of the Great Continent, thus their name. Northerners consist of the warrior orcs race, the enslaved <ref>text='goblins' dst='..race_goblin'</ref>, <ref>text='trolls' dst='..race_troll'</ref> who are tricked into combat by the orcs, and the serpentine <ref>text='naga' dst='..race_naga'</ref>. The Northerners play best by taking advantage of having many low-cost and high HP soldiers."

The moon was high, the night was old,
Brave was the drake that dared forsake
His home to steal the Basilisk’s gold.

On that dark night, the skies so churned,
He disregarded what he had learned,
Foolish but brave, to the Basilisk’s cave,
He flew, and the fire within him burned.

Alas, that fire burns no more,
For the Basilisk, with one mighty roar,
Chilled him to the bone, and he turned to stone,
And so he stays forevermore.

The winds of the sky blow so cold,
The years pass by, the days are old,
Here stands that drake, who dared forsake
His home to steal the Basilisk’s gold.

            description=_ "Xikkrisx of Syrsszk was a powerful Saurian warrior, sent to this region by the Elders of the Rysssrylosszkk Clan (translation: “The Hunts-Foes-In-Boiling-Rivers Clan”). The Elders were preparing to make war on a human outpost, and were in great need of the powerful magics of Oxsrrsk, a Saurian Mystic who had last been seen heading in the direction of Ruaskkolin Lake. Xikkrisx found the petrified body of Oxsrrsk, along with a carefully bound scroll that had apparently been dropped into a small crevice in the cave floor. He opened the scroll and read a brief passage from the middle of the text: “After he was bound and cast from the Upper World, Chak’kso’s enraged spirit sought release, and was able to exert a corrupting influence on certain regions of the Upper World, channeled through ‘pathways of stone’ that extend from the surface into the depths of the Under Reaches. This rage altered the eggs of great lizards, shaping their bodies and spirits into implements of Chak’kso’s hatred.” Confused, Xikkrisx fixed his attention on the task at hand. Thinking that perhaps the Elders could find some way to restore Oxsrrsk, he began the long and strenuous task of hauling the statue back to the domain of the Rysssrylosszkk Clan. Exhausted, and not having traveled far from the lake, Xikkrisx set the statue down inside of a small cave, and lay down to rest. He was awoken by a bone-chilling roar."

            description=_ "Oxsrrsk was a powerful Saurian Oracle, who had, in a raid against the rival Xraxss Clan, acquired (from the vaults of the now-dead Oracle Hesx-Rzzak) a most fascinating scroll. The scroll was entitled “Ney’yks of the Granite Gaze,” and told of a creature known as the “Chak’kso Ney’yks,” a name which, in an ancient saurian tongue, meant “Eldest Child of Chak’kso.” Chak’kso was believed to have been a powerful demigod of the Under Reaches, described as a ‘great demon of the earth’ in the Elvish Histories. According to these histories, Chak’kso had once sought to transform all life on the planet to stone; so great was his hatred for creatures of flesh. He was ultimately defeated and bound by powerful magics, but in the centuries following his banishment (to a realm far below the surface of the world) a new breed of creature began appearing in the Histories, a breed with the ability to turn any being of flesh into stone. There was a period when these Basilisks (as they came to be known) wreaked havoc on the world of the living, turning thousands to stone. One by one, and at great cost, the Basilisks were defeated. All, it would seem, but one; the Basilisk known as “The Ney’yks,” or “The Eldest Child,” in the modern tongue. Supremely convinced of his ability to locate and bind this powerful creature into his service, Oxsrrsk set out on his journey..."

His leadership and skills alone were what kept the area’s goblins alive despite human and elvish menaces. Rumor had it that his wolf had slain fifty men and a hundred Elves.
Thus, when he heard of the awful monster that was inhabiting the area, it was only natural that he ride out alone to face it. All the other goblins expected him to slay the creature easily and drag back its carcass to feast on.
He was in for quite a shock. As soon as he saw the Basilisk, Blum Duk cowered in fright. He tried to wheel his wolf around to run away, but it wouldn’t move. As the creature stalked towards him, he screamed his last words: Good Gog, dog, are yer legs made of stone?!

Once, even, he confided in a fellow that his greatest wish was to be able to bask forever in the sun’s glory.
However, not long after, the local wose community heard of the approach of a horrible monster, powerful enough to easily destroy the few woses that lived in the area. They quickly moved off (quickly for Woses, anyway), but Bramwythl was left behind — in their haste, no one had remembered to find him and tell him of the danger.
He was taken quite unawares by the Basilisk, and turned to stone before he even recognized the beast. His petrified form still stands there today, warmed by the sun’s rays, under an open sky. His greatest wish has been granted.

Having prepared himself for battle with the Serpent, Rilhon met with two rather large surprises. The first was the petrified form of Ruaskkolin the Serpent. The second was the very-much-alive Chak’kso Ney’yks, who was, oddly enough, in possession of all of his teeth.

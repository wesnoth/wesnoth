    _ "Your aim is to survive the spawning waves of units and defeat the final archenemies. The spawning waves are randomly generated and will be different each time Isle of Mists is played. They appear along the north, south, and west map edges — though they are most likely to spawn on the west edge. The waves appear at somewhat regular intervals. The weather will also change randomly, affecting the layout of the map."

    description= _ "This most unusual of caves was once known as the Chamber of Laughing Devils, and was the inner citadel of the Kah Ruuk Oni. The Kah Ruuk were a wicked and cunning race of man-eating demons, who terrorized the people of the Eastern Lands for nearly four hundred years, before vanishing from Irdya without a trace. Since that time, many factions have vied for dominion over the Den of Onis, hoping to unlock the strange and mysterious magics of its creators."

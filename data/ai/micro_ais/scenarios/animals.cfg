#define ANIMAL_AI_DESCRIPTIONS1
    _"<u>General</u>: These AIs are set up to simulate (to some extent) how these animals behave in real life. This includes that they are animals, meaning that they are not super smart. As an example, the wolves generally hunt in a pack, but are easily distracted by prey coming into range. They are also decent, but not great at cornering deer. For the most part, this is intentional.

<u>Bears (replaced by Ghasts), Spiders and Yetis</u> mostly just wander in their respective parts of the map. They stay out of each other's way (and out of the way of the dogs), but do attack each other if cornered. They attack the other, weaker animals (deer etc.) if those are within range.

<u>Wolves</u> hunt in a pack. They actively go after the closest deer (as long as it stays in the forest) and try to corner it (not always super successfully), but are easily distracted by other prey coming into range. The wolves try to avoid getting into the range of bears, spiders, dogs and the yeti, except when they are going in for an attack. If you let them move for long enough, they will also learn that it is not healthy to attack the tusklets. When no deer is left, they wander randomly. Note that, unlike the Wolves Multipack AI (used in a different scenario), this Wolves AI combines all wolves of the side in the same pack."

#define ANIMAL_AI_DESCRIPTIONS2
    _"Each <u>Deer (replaced by Vampire Bats)</u> wanders randomly on forest tiles, except when enemies get in its (the deer's) range, in which case it flees to the farthest point it can reach.

<u>Tuskers (replaced by Ogres)</u> exhibit the same behavior as deer, except when an enemy is next to one of the tusklets. This enemy will then experience the full wrath of an irate boar.

<u>Tusklets (replaced by Young Ogres)</u> blindly follow the closest adult tusker, except when there is no tusker left, in which case they behave the same as deer.

<u>Rabbits (replaced by Rats)</u> also wander randomly, but in addition disappear into their holes (replaced by straw bales; if any are within reach) when enemies are close. They reappear out of their holes at the beginning of the turn, if it is safe.

<u>Sheep dogs (replaced by Footpads)</u> try to keep their sheep safe. This involves keeping them inside the area outlined by the path the dogs have worn into the meadow, positioning themselves in between the sheep and approaching enemies, and attacking the enemies if those get too close. You might have to let the scenario play for quite some time before you get to see an interesting dog/wolf interaction. If no active herding or protecting move is needed, the dogs go to a random location on the path.

<u>Sheep (replaced by Troll Whelps)</u> wander aimlessly except when a sheep dog is next to them, in which case they run away from the dog. The dogs exploit this by positioning themselves on the outside of the sheep, if possible. Sheep also run away from approaching enemies. The sheep, dogs and forest creatures (deer, tuskers, rabbits) have learned that they are no threat to each other and leave each other alone, demonstrating the enormous self control of a well trained sheep dog."

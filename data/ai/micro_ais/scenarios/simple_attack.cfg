<i>Translation: The undead side includes two instances of the Simple Attack Micro AI.  The first makes the Soulless attack all units 1 XP from leveling up, such that they can be eliminated afterward.  The second executes all remaining attacks possible by Soulless (and Walking Corpses), without regard for their own safety.  Only after that does the default Wesnoth attack mechanism kick in to attack with the remaining units (skeletons).</i>"}

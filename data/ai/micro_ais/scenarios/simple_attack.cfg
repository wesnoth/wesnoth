<i>If you’re porting an old scenario, you may find the Simple Attack Micro AI used in a way that’s unnecessary since 1.14. The 1.12 AI generally doesn’t attack units one XP from leveling if there is no chance of killing the unit with a single attack. One way of making 1.12 do those attacks was to use the Simple Attack Micro AI.</i>"

Worse for you, I have given special instruction to my Soulless to attack all your almost-advanced units first. Also watch how those same Soulless will throw themselves mercilessly at your pitiful soldiers after that, saving my more valuable skeleton minions for later. I have taken the term ‘disposable units’ to a whole new level. Watch in awe!!

<i>Translation: The undead side includes two instances of the Simple Attack Micro AI. The first makes the Soulless attack all units 1 XP from leveling up, such that they can be eliminated afterward. The second executes all remaining attacks possible by Soulless (and Walking Corpses), without regard for their own safety. Only after that does the default Wesnoth attack mechanism kick in to attack with the remaining units (skeletons), and it moves the remaining units with high caution and low aggression.</i>

<i>The difference to the 1.12 version of this demo is that the 1.12 skeletons still had high aggression.</i>"

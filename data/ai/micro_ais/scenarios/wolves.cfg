        {MESSAGE narrator "wesnoth-icon.png" "" _"This scenario features a different kind of wolf behavior from 'Animals'. First, there can be an arbitrary number of wolf packs and the pack size on each side is a free parameter (set to 3 for Side 2 and 4 for Side 3 in this scenario). At the beginning of the scenario, close wolves are grouped into packs in a semi-methodical way. Wolves of the same pack begin by joining each other on the map. After that, they stay together until only one wolf is left, which then tries to join up with an incomplete pack or with other single wolves. Individual wolves entering the map during the scenario behave in that way as well.

Second, wolves do not actively hunt here. For the most part they just wander (often long distance). However, the pack ferociously (and without regard for its own health) attacks any enemy units that come into range, as long as that does not mean separating the pack by more than a few hexes. Staying together, or joining with a new wolf assigned to the pack, is the only thing that takes priority over satisfying the wolves' thirst for blood.

To emphasize which wolf belongs to which pack, the pack number will be displayed below each wolf in this scenario once the AI takes control of a side the first time."}

            message= _ "It is possible to include a human-controlled Side 1, so that the action stops once every turn for looking around (or for messing with things in debug mode). In human-controlled mode, several options are available through the right-click menu, such as adding additional wolves to either side, taking wolves off the map, adding peasants to the human-controlled side or ending the scenario. This enables easy exploring of the wolf AI behavior under different circumstances.

Note that the leader of the human-controlled side, Rutburt, can move 99 hexes per turn, so that it is always possible to keep him out of harm's way.

Also note that the wolves AI is coded as a Micro AI. A Micro AI can be added and adapted to the need of a scenario easily using only WML and the [micro_ai] tag.

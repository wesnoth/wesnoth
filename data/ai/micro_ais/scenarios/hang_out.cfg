Note: This scenario uses a combination of two Micro AIs, the Hang Out Micro AI which makes the Side 2 units remain around the keep for two turns (while moving off castle tiles to allow for recruiting) and the Messenger Escort AI which takes over after that.  A Micro AI can be added and adapted to the need of a scenario easily using only WML and the [micro_ai] tag. Check out the <span color='#00A000'>Micro AI wiki page</span> at http://wiki.wesnoth.org/Micro_AIs for more information."}

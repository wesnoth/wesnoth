        {MESSAGE narrator "wesnoth-icon.png" _"Notes" _"The Messenger Escort AI will try to move the dragoon messenger to the signpost in the north, while protecting him as well as possible with the other units. Vanak's orcs need to stop him.

Note that the messenger route is set up through a series of waypoints here simply to demonstrate how to use waypoints. On this map, using only a single waypoint at the end of the route would work just as well (or probably even better).

Also note that the messenger does not have to get exactly to each signpost (except for the last one), getting close is good enough.

The Messenger Escort AI is coded as a Micro AI. A Micro AI can be added and adapted to the need of a scenario easily using only WML and the [micro_ai] tag. Check out the <span color='#00A000'>Micro AI wiki page</span> at http://wiki.wesnoth.org/Micro_AIs for more information."}

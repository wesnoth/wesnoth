        {MESSAGE narrator "wesnoth-icon.png" "Notes" _"If you have not changed anything in the scenario code, Side 1 uses the Random Recruitment Micro AI, with swordsmen and peasants having been given higher probability than the other units, and mages a middling probability. This is not meant as a good recruitment pattern, it simply serves as a demonstration how to use the AI.

Side 2 uses the Rush Recruitment Micro AI (which is also used in the Experimental AI).

A Micro AI can be added and adapted to the need of a scenario easily using only WML and the [micro_ai] tag. Check out the <span color='#00A000'>Micro AI wiki page</span> at http://wiki.wesnoth.org/Micro_AIs for more information."}

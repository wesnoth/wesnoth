        {MESSAGE Rebels1 "" "" _"In this scenario, we demonstrate the use of the Healer Support Micro AI. This AI configures the healers of a side to stay behind the battle lines and heal injured and/or threatened units rather than participate in the attacks under all circumstances. It includes several configurable options (which are set differently for the two sides in this scenario) that determine how aggressive/careful the healers are, whether they also attack, how much risk they are willing to take, etc.

For clarity, each healer announces her upcoming support move. If you don't want to see that each time, just hit 'esc' when it happens the first time.

Note: The Healer Support AI is coded as a Micro AI. A Micro AI can be added and adapted to the need of a scenario easily using only WML and the [micro_ai] tag. Check out the <span color='#00A000'>Micro AI wiki page</span> at http://wiki.wesnoth.org/Micro_AIs for more information."}

        {MESSAGE narrator "wesnoth-icon.png" "" _"This scenario features bats moving around in a swarm. Without adjacent enemies, they simply try to stay together and at a certain distance from enemies. However, if an enemy unit is close to any bat, the swarm scatters. This is particular fun to watch when one places an enemy unit in the middle of the swarm. After being scattered, the swarm members slowly rejoin, but not in a very organized way. Sub-swarms or individual bats might roam around for quite some time before they find their way back. It is also possible that individual bats (or small groups) split off from the larger swarm at times.

The player controls a side of gryphons, each of which is given 99 moves so that the reaction of the swarm to enemies can be tested easily. There are also several right-click options, for example for adding bats or gryphons or for taking units off the map.

Note: The Swarm AI is coded as a Micro AI. A Micro AI can be added and adapted to the need of a scenario easily using only WML and the [micro_ai] tag. Check out the <span color='#00A000'>Micro AI wiki page</span> at http://wiki.wesnoth.org/Micro_AIs for more information."}

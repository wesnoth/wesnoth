I am heading for the keep east of the central mountain via a couple waypoints in the south. I will stay there once I get there. By contrast, those two fellas in the center are perpetually circling the mountain, one of them always in the same direction, the other changing directions after every lap.

All of this is implemented by use of the Patrol [micro_ai] tag."}

        # wmllint: unbalanced-on
        {MESSAGE narrator "wesnoth-icon.png" _"Notes" _"You, as the player, are in charge of Gertburt's bandits in this scenario. You can either simply watch the patrols move around, or you can move units into their way. The three patrol units are instructed to behave differently when facing enemy units:

Konrad only attacks Gertburt, or any enemy unit that blocks his final waypoint.

The Swordsman never attacks at all.

The Longbowman attacks any enemy unit he ends up next to at the end of his move.

They all have in common, however, that getting to their next waypoint takes priority over attacking. They will thus prefer to move around enemies rather than straight for them. Also, if a waypoint is occupied by a unit they are not instructed to attack, they will (eventually) abandon that waypoint once they get close enough and move on to the next one.

The Patrol AI controlling all Side 2 units is coded as a Micro AI. A Micro AI can be added and adapted to the need of a scenario easily using only WML and the [micro_ai] tag. Check out the <span color='#00A000'>Micro AI wiki page</span> at http://wiki.wesnoth.org/Micro_AIs for more information."}

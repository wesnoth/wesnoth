        {MESSAGE Rowck "" "" _"Hi there. I am Rowck and here is what I do:
When hungry, I move around part of the map in a random wander until I get into range of an enemy. If enemies are within range, I attack and devour the weakest of them. After that, I retreat to my rest location, where I stay for a certain number of turns or until fully healed.
A few details (features, not bugs, but can be changed if desired):
- If my way home is blocked on the return, the normal RCA AI takes over my behavior.
- I will, however, attack any enemy occupying my rest hex, if I can get there.
- A kill only makes me go home when I am the attacker, not as defender.
- Occasionally I will not move at all while wandering (a dragon has to rest sometimes!)

Note: The Hunter AI is coded as a Micro AI. A Micro AI can be added and adapted to the need of a scenario easily using only WML and the [micro_ai] tag. Check out the <span color='#00A000'>Micro AI wiki page</span> at http://wiki.wesnoth.org/Micro_AIs for more information."}

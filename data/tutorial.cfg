		message="You have to carefully review their skills. Early on, you want fast units to sieze as many villages as possible. After that, fighters should probably make up the bulk of your army. Remember that all Elvish units fight very well in forest. Horsemen are excellent on open ground. Mages are good for support, and can be used much like archers. If you can get your mages more experienced, they can be especially powerful."

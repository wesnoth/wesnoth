tip_of_day9="Units stationed in villages heal 8 hitpoints at the beginning of their turn."
tip_of_day10="Units that do not move or attack during their turn rest, and will recover 2 hitpoints at the beginning of their next turn."
tip_of_day11="Most foot units defend better in villages and castles than in most other terrain, while most mounted units don't get any defensive advantage in villages and castles."
tip_of_day12="Horse based units are generally resistant to attacks with bladed or impact weapons, but are vulnerable to attacks with piercing weapons, including bows and spears."
tip_of_day13="Inflicting the killing blow on an enemy unit is the best way to gain experience. Units killing an enemy will gain 8 experience for every level of the unit they kill."
tip_of_day14="Elvish units move and fight very well in forest. Dwarvish units move and fight very well in hills and mountains."
tip_of_day15="Patience is often key. Rather than attacking in bad conditions, or with few troops, wait for better conditions and then attack."
tip_of_day16="If you are attacked from several directions, it may be a good idea to send expendable units in some directions to delay enemy units."
tip_of_day17="Do not be afraid to retreat and regroup, it is often the key to victory."
tip_of_day18="In most campaigns you will receive a gold bonus for finishing early, depending on the number of villages on the map, and the number of turns you finish early. You will always earn more gold this way than through capturing villages and waiting for turns to run out."
tip_of_day19="Your leader can recruit or recall units from any keep inside a castle, not just the keep they start on. You can capture a keep from an enemy and recruit from there. Also, some of your allies may be willing to make room for you on their keep so you can recruit there."
tip_of_day20="Skeletons are resistant to piercing and bladed attacks, but vulnerable to impact, fire, and holy attacks."
tip_of_day21="Units with leadership ability make lower level adjacent units on the same side fight better."

tip_of_day23="Holding the mouse cursor on an ability or trait shows a description of that ability or trait."
tip_of_day24="Use lines of units to screen injured units to let them recover."
tip_of_day25="Read the hotkeys list in the preferences menu."
tip_of_day26="If you move a unit, but don't attack or discover any additional information, you can undo your move by pressing 'u'."
tip_of_day27="You can see how far enemy units can move by moving the mouse cursor over them."
tip_of_day28="Use healers to support your attacks - they will win you battles without needing to attack anything themselves."
tip_of_day29="The 'slow' attack ability makes enemy units move slower, but it also gives them one less attack than they would normally have. It is thus very effective against units that have a few powerful attacks."
tip_of_day30="Holy attacks are very powerful against undead."
tip_of_day31="Units are healed when they advance a level. Used wisely, this can turn a fight."
tip_of_day32="Charging units are best used against enemies they can kill with a single blow."

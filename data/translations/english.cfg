tip_of_day14= _ "Elvish units move and fight very well in forest. Dwarvish units move and fight very well in hills and mountains."

tip_of_day16= _ "If you are attacked from several directions, it may be a good idea to send expendable units in some directions to delay enemy units."
tip_of_day17= _ "Do not be afraid to retreat and regroup, it is often the key to victory."
tip_of_day18= _ "In most campaigns you will receive a gold bonus for finishing early, depending on the number of villages on the map, and the number of turns you finish early. You will always earn more gold this way than through capturing villages and waiting for turns to run out."
tip_of_day19= _ "Your leader can recruit or recall units from any keep inside a castle, not just the keep they start on. You can capture a keep from an enemy and recruit from there. Also, some of your allies may be willing to make room for you on their keep so you can recruit there."

tip_of_day28= _ "Use healers to support your attacks - they will win you battles without needing to attack anything themselves."
tip_of_day29= _ "The 'slow' attack ability makes enemy units move slower, but it also gives them one less attack than they would normally have. It is thus very effective against units that have a few powerful attacks."
tip_of_day30= _ "Holy attacks are very powerful against undead."
tip_of_day31= _ "Units are healed when they advance a level. Used wisely, this can turn a fight."
tip_of_day32= _ "Charging units are best used against enemies they can kill with a single blow."

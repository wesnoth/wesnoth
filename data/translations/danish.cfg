council_1="Greetings, and welcome to our capital. You should feel honored. It has been half a century - a generation in the way your race counts time - since any man has been considered Elf-friend enough to stand here."
council_10="I had no idea! Thank you, my lady. It is a pleasure to meet you again."
council_11="Rescued him from my mother? But nineteen years ago Konrad would have been an infant! What is this you are talking about?"
council_12="Your mother has much blood upon her hands, child. She has had many killed unjustly. When Konrad was an infant, she ordered all the princes put to death, so she could sieze control."
council_13="She had them murdered? There were others too, not just Konrad? Surely you do not speak the truth! Parandra, what do you say?"
council_14="Princess, when Delfador the Great speaks of the Queen Mother, Asheviere, ordering the princes of Wesnoth to be put to death, he speaks the truth."
council_15="And what say you, Elf-king?"
council_16="I did not see it myself, Princess, but I have heard many reliable reports. Asheviere indeed has the blood of the princes on her hands. She has also allowed Orcs to desecrate the lands, abandoning all respect for the peoples around her."
council_17a="Well, that is why I must take the Scepter. I will return, and people will accept me as Queen. I will rule justly and fairly. My mother is only Queen Mother. The throne is rightfully mine, and with the Scepter I can prove it."
council_17b="Princess, there is some good in you, but the throne is not yours to claim. Konrad has the Scepter. He will take the throne."
council_17d="Well, I have the Scepter! I will return and the people will accept me as Queen! My mother is only Queen Mother. The Throne is rightfully mine, and I will rule from it with justice and fairness. I may even accept you as my advisor and counselor, Delfador"
council_17e="Though you have the Scepter, Princess, it is rightfully Konrad's. You  have it now only because we helped you get it."
council_17f="And if I refuse to give it to him?"
council_17g="If it is necessary, princess, I will ask Konrad to fight you in a duel for it."
council_17h="Delfador! Li'sar has become our friend. I don't want to fight her! As long as she rules well, what does it matter if she becomes queen?"
council_17i="You are the rightful heir. You should be king, Konrad."
council_18="Delfador, you have raised Konrad to be skillful and wise, honorable and just. A warrior who has respect, and appreciates peace. Yet the throne is not the place for him. You know of what I speak, Delfador."
council_19="But I do not! What is your meaning, Parandra?"
council_2="We are indeed honored."
council_20="In time, things will be revealed, fair Princess. For the moment, go forth and claim the throne of Wesnoth."
council_20a="Parandra, what you say may seem right to some, but as long as you and I speak to no-one of what we know, I see no reason why Konrad would not best have the throne."
council_20b="In so many things you are right, Delfador, and your wisdom is unmatched in the world of men. But in this, you are mistaken. Li'sar is the heir. She should take the throne. Now that I have met her for myself, I am sure of it."
council_21="She will claim the throne, and not me? What should I do?"
council_22="Li'sar should be Queen, but you will go with her. Indeed, I suspect we could not convince you otherwise. I have seen the way you look at her, Konrad. I think that now you would follow her even to the ends of the earth."
council_23="With all due respect, my lady, she is my cousin! There is nothing between us!"
council_24="Then if it is as you say, Konrad, perhaps you should stay here with us. It would surely be safer for you. The Elves could show you things that would amaze you, things that no man has seen before."
council_25="That is a generous offer, my lady, but you are indeed right, I would rather go with Li'sar."
council_26="And what say you, Uradredia?"
council_27="Tell me, Li'sar, are you willing to fight your own mother for the throne?"
council_28="It is for the good of the country. If it is necessary, I will fight her, Elf-king."
council_29="I feel that this lady speaks the truth. Delfador, although I know that you do not concur, the words of Parandra, daughter of Elandria are wise. Rest here for a time, and then go forth with them."
council_3="I might also say that it is you who are honored. It has been so long since you have been graced by with the presence of a princess of Wesnoth."
council_30="And you have been with us for a time, Kalenz son of Kliada, what say you?"
council_31="Wisdom has been spoken here today, Delfador. We have been with Li'sar in the most trying of times, and risked life and limb with her. Yet we still have both our lives and our limbs. She lacks experience, and has too much of the brashness of youth, but she will make a good Queen in time."
council_32="So, the Elven Council has spoken. But which path should we take on our journey? The Ford of Abez will not be passible, for surely it will be watched and guarded by many men."
council_33="There is another way by which you can return to Wesnoth: past the mountains of the dragons and through the dark valley. To the land of the East, from there you can return to Wesnoth and surprise the Dark Queen, catching her off-guard."
council_34="Mountains of the dragons? That sounds very dangerous! I didn't even think there were such things as dragons!"
council_35="No dragon has been sighted in those mountains for many years, but they retain their name of old. Still, that path will be dangerous for us. Is there not another route we might take?"
council_36="All routes are dangerous, though there is some hope along this path. Rest, and then go forth, friends. Fortune has smiled upon you so far, despite great dangers. Perhaps she will continue to do so."
council_4="Silence, foolish girl! With such arrogance, is it any surprise that the royal family of Wesnoth long ago saw their ancient alliances fall to pieces?"
council_5="Yes...you are right, sir. It is I who am honored to be here, and I apologize for my discourtesy."
council_6="Delfador the Great. As wise with his tongue in advice as he is strong with his staff in battle. A rare combination, especially among men."
council_7="How quickly do the race of men mature! Only nineteen winters have passed since I last laid eyes on you, Konrad, yet you are now a grown man. A brave warrior stands before me!"
council_8="Forgive me, Elf, but I'm afraid I do not recall meeting you before."

They have no long range attack, but can charge into combat, inflicting double normal damage, though taking double damage in return. They are also lawful, meaning they are better at day, and worse at night. Horsemen are unmatched on open land, though Elves will serve you better in rugged terrain."

msg_orc2_16="Argh!  I die!"
msg_orc2_2="What are these orcs doing here?  They should be too tired to live."
msg_orc2_20="We've succeeded!  We've passed through the Mountains of Haag!  Look at these green hills!  The land of the free tribes is near now.  I can see the walls of Barag-Gor in the distance."
msg_orc2_21="Blemaker, many thanks for your help in this fight.  Would you like to join us in our journey with your son?  Your help would be very appreciated!"
msg_orc2_22="Father, I'd like to join them.  Would you mind it?"
msg_orc2_23="My son, you're old enough to discover the world.  Me, I have to stay here.  But take care, there are plenty of creatures that seek our end, like elves or humans.  They are as clever as merciless."
msg_orc2_24="Thanks, father.  Don't worry, I'll take care of myself."
msg_orc2_25="We've succeeded!  We've passed through the Mountains of Haag!  Look at these green hills!  The land of the free tribes is near now.  I can see the walls of Barag-Gor in the distance."
msg_orc2_26="Grüü, many thanks for your help in this fight.  I'm sorry for your father.  Would you like to join us in our journey?  Your help would be very appreciated!"
msg_orc2_27="My father would have come to help you.  I would insult his memory not to help you.  I come!"
msg_orc2_3="I've never pushed so far, we are crossing the border of the Black Eye lands."
msg_orc2_4="Look!  Dwarves are fighting against orcs!"
msg_orc2_5="Father, we should help them.  Orcs are our allies."
msg_orc2_6="I don't know if we should do that.  Orcs have been our allies in the past, but they have always treated us as fools."
msg_orc2_7="But Father, we don't know what they are seeking there, maybe this is a good occasion to get rid of these dwarves."
msg_orc2_8="You are right, my son.  We will help our orcish friends.  But take care of you ... I would be desperate if something would happen to you."
msg_orc3_1="Here is Barag Gor."
msg_orc3_10="You are right, we have to go to a safer place.  You have helped us.  Would you help us again and escort us to the Harbour of Tirigaz?"
msg_orc3_11="Yes, I need to ask for assistance from whole council.  I'm with you."
msg_orc3_12="Excellent.  This is a dangerous journey, as we have to take a road near the elvish forest.  This is the road near that yellow farm."
msg_orc3_13="They are retreating at last!"
msg_orc3_14="Yes, but I can see that more are pouring from the forest.  We are not in safety."
msg_orc3_15="You are right, we have to leave to a safer place.  You have helped us.  Would you help us again and escort us to the Harbour of Tirigaz?"
msg_orc3_16="Yes, I need to ask for assistance to the whole council.  I'm with you."
msg_orc3_17="Excellent.  This is a dangerous journey, as we have to take a road near the elvish forest.  This is the road near this yellow farm."
msg_orc3_19="We've made it!  Our journey is still long.  Hurry up, my people!"
msg_orc3_2="Oh no!  They are besieged by elves.  We must help our brothers to get rid of this mob.  But these filthy elves are so numerous."
msg_orc3_20="They are destroying our castle!  To my rescue my merry Elves!"
msg_orc3_21="At your service, Etheliel.  Let push these evil creatures back to their quag!"
msg_orc3_3="I have a subtle plan, chief."
msg_orc3_4="Which plan?"
msg_orc3_5="We go and we kill all of them.  What do you think?"
msg_orc3_6="..."
msg_orc3_7="Then, Kapou'e launched his desperate attack to stop the siege of Barag Gor."
msg_orc3_7_1="Freedom!  Many thanks, Son of The Black Eye.  I'm Jetto, master of assassins, now you can count on the assassins guild to help you in your quest!"
msg_orc3_8="They are retreating at last!"
msg_orc3_9="We're not out of the woods yet.  I can see that more are pouring from the forest.  We are not in safety."
msg_orc4_1="Ahhh, I'm so tired.  It was a good idea to halt in such a quiet place."
msg_orc4_10="The day is coming, these night creatures will soon return to the pit."
msg_orc4_11="Grüü, are you forgeting we are ALSO night creatures?"
msg_orc4_12="Err... well..."
msg_orc4_2="It is too quiet.  Just plain boring."
msg_orc4_3="Shut up, I just heard something."
msg_orc4_4="You're right.  I can see something is moving in these hills.  Looks like there are undead there."
msg_orc4_5="Excellent!  It is time for exercise!"
msg_orc4_6="Hmmm, what neat bottle!  What is it?"
msg_orc4_7="It is written H.O.L.Y W.A.T.E.R"
msg_orc4_8="I'm thirsty ... *gulp* *gulp*"
msg_orc4_9="Ahhh, that was yummy!"
msg_orc5_1="So here is Tirigaz."
msg_orc5_10="I love this strategy, chief!"
msg_orc5_12="Pillage!  Let's plunder these orcs!"
msg_orc5_2="Looks like they are to be facing attack from pirates of the High Sea.  We should help them."
msg_orc5_22="Aaaargh!  I die!"
msg_orc5_23="Finally you paid for all of what you did to my Orc brothers!"
msg_orc5_24="We're back! We have bad news, the humans are regrouping on our tails, we must leave."
msg_orc5_25="But where is the rest of the council?  We haven't made such a long journey to flee!"
msg_orc5_26="We had news from them, all of them fled to the East, near the Mourned Hills.  I think we should go for them as soon as possible and evacuate this city."
msg_orc5_27="But it is beyond the Desert of Death, which is full of poisonous giant scorpions and outlaws.  And bypassing it would take ages!  Not to mention after this desert, we'll have to cross the Silent Forest!"
msg_orc5_28="So we have no choice ... I've never tasted scorpions but sure, this journey promises to be fun."
msg_orc5_3="I propose that Gork, you and I call for reinforcements."
msg_orc5_4="Call for reinforcements?  Do you mean you don't want to fight for our brothers?  Are you a coward, Vraurk?"
msg_orc5_5="Me?  I'll show you if I'm a coward!"
msg_orc5_6="It is not time for quarreling!  I'm to contain them, go find reinforcements."
msg_orc5_7="This is a wise choice.  Good luck, son of the Black Eye."
msg_orc5_8="Haha!  Our plan is going well, let surround them on land while our allies attack them from sea!"
msg_orc5_9="We are attacked from both sides!  Grüü, hold them while I run to Tirigaz to find forces to counter attack.  Although we can't defeat those pirates without naval forces, we can wipe humans out of this region."
msg_orc6_1="It's been two days since we entered this desert.  I have never been so hot and we have nearly finished our food."
msg_orc6_10="We've done it!  Now we need some rest, before we continue our journey."
msg_orc6_2="I'm hungry and we found no giant scorpion yet.  I'm sure it would be delicious."
msg_orc6_3="I hope we won't find one!  They are terrible armored beasts and your troll clubs are useless against their heavy shells."
msg_orc6_4="I've been told the best way to defeat them is to attack their eyes with sharp blades.  But I hope too we won't meet them."
msg_orc6_5="The sun is rising, we should resume our journey and find this oasis mentioned on the map before the sun get high."
msg_orc6_6="Stay alert!  This oasis is known to be a den of outlaws and desert pillagers."
msg_orc7_1="So here is the Silent Forest ... why is it named that way?  Is it really that silent?"
msg_orc7_10="We've done it!  Now we need some rest, before we continue our journey."
msg_orc7_11="No more elves?  Where are you cowards!?"
msg_orc7_12="Don't shout that loud, stupid troll.  Do you remember we are in the Silent Forest?  Perhaps there more are to come."
msg_orc7_13="I don't think so.  They must have fled.  Now that this forest has been cleared of elves, we can have a rest and then continue our journey."
msg_orc7_2="It has not always been that silent.  A lot of hunters from tribes used to hunt there and fish in the Bork river.  But now, no one would enter there unless forced."
msg_orc7_3="Some people say these woods are haunted."
msg_orc7_4="The fact is that few people entered this forest and returned home safe.  Most likely, this forest is full of elvish renegades."
msg_orc7_5="Anyway, we need some rest.  We are sufficiently armed to cope with a bunch of elvish poachers.  If we ever meet some, I'll push them into the Bork river with great delight."
msg_orc7_6="What is that?  Orcs entering our forest?  Fools!  None of them will return alive!"
msg_orc7_7="I agree.  We'll attack them on both sides."
msg_orc9_1="At last, here are the mourned hills!  I hope everything will be OK."
msg_orc9_10="Exasperated, Kapou'e launched an attack on his fellow orc Shan Taum the Smug."
msg_orc9_2="Why?"
msg_orc9_21="Nooo!  Don't kill me, I surrender to you little earthworm."
msg_orc9_3="Only trolls don't know that these lands are ruled by Shan Taum the Smug, who was a rival for Black Eye Karun."
msg_orc9_30="What is this?  Are you mad!?  Humans are to besiege our fortress at Prestim and you are fighting each other!?"
msg_orc9_31="Well, ermmm..."
msg_orc9_32="Kapou'e, rumors tell you made a long trip to seek assistance from us, and escorting Pirk, Gork and Vraurk.  The council is grateful for that."
msg_orc9_33="I know what you want from us but I'm afraid we can't help you."
msg_orc9_34="Really?  But my people..."
msg_orc9_36="You don't understand.  Orcs have been divided for ages.  The only one who gave us some unity was your father, Black Eye Karun.  Hearing rumors from your exploits, we understood you are a worthy son of your father."
msg_orc9_37="This is true.  Now we are pressured from all sides by humans and elves; we need a leader that can unite all banners.  This one is YOU!"
msg_orc9_38="Well, I'm not sure I deserve that..."
msg_orc9_39="Did you hear?  There is a battle waiting for us at Prestim!"
msg_orc9_4="I doubt he would welcome the son of the Black Eye."
msg_orc9_40="Kapou'e, if Prestim falls, humans will have a strong bridgehead on this side of the river and your people won't be safe.  You are the only one that can help us defend Prestim!"
msg_orc9_41="Leave your people here Kapou'e--they are safe for the moment--and go defend Prestim.  In the meantime, now that the council is complete again, we will decide if we have to form the Great Horde again and give you the leadership on it."
msg_orc9_5="Who is that?  Kapou'e!  What are you doing in my lands you ridiculous born loser?"
msg_orc9_6="Hold on, Shan Taum. We are not here to quarrel, we are here to escort our brothers and to deliberate about what we have to do."
msg_orc9_7="Bwahaha!  You are nothing!  Where is your land?  You became a beggar.  You are as pathetic as your father!"
msg_orc9_8="How can you talk that way about my father, you miserable coward?!  I'll make a mug with your skull!"
msg_orc9_9="Really?  What would you drink with it?  Mint cordial?"
msg_orc_10_1="Reinforcements, at least!  Whoever you are, you are welcome in Prestim!  The fortified bridge over the Gork river has been taken this morning by a small commando of elves, we already tried to assault it twice without success."
msg_orc_10_2="Ah!  They are no match against my mace."
msg_orc_10_3="There is worse, our scouts reported that our saurians allies led by Inarix are still blocked on the other side of the river some miles away. They won't be able to cross the river."
msg_orc_10_4="Elves and dwarves have joined humans against us and are camping near.  Humans will arrive soon.  We must destroy the southern bridge on the river."
msg_orc_10_5="We must do something!"
msg_orc_10_6="I know what we must do.  Kill elves and help Inarix cross."
msg_orc_10_7="It won't be that easy!  Our enemies are well entrenchered.  And don't forget, we will sabotage the southern bridge as soon as the bulk of Saurians army will have crossed!"
msg_orc_10_8="Each warrior trapped on the bridge or on the other side of the river will perish!"
msg_orc_17_1="We're safe, finally.  Hurry up Kapou'e, come with us, we need to reach Tirigaz as soon as possible."

nelves_12a="Trouble? What kind of trouble?"
nelves_13a="We have sighted a great host to the south, a host of the men of Wesnoth. And we believe they are looking for you! There is not a moment to lose. You must make haste to the Elven forest. Only there will you be safe!"
nelves_14a="I only hope we can avoid them. We will have to bear north-east."
nelves_15a="That is not all, my lord. The foul Orcs have heard of the coming of these men, and are even now gathering a great host to oppose them to the north! It is now certain that there will be a great battle."
nelves_16a="This sounds very dangerous. Perhaps we should retreat to the West, and hide until the battle is over?"
nelves_17a="I think these wild lands are too dangerous for that! Anyhow...I expected you to be on the side of Wesnoth, Princess?"
nelves_18a="I am an honorable princess, not an imposter like you! I promised that I would be on your side until we made it out of these lands, and I will keep my promise!"

nelves_20a="Come then, Konrad, let us go."
nelves_21a="My lord has begun assembling a party of Elves to come and escort you into the forest. Beware, for we are all in great danger!"
nelves_22="Greetings, Elf-friend! Welcome to Emetria. You must take shelter here until the battle passes. If you stay with me here for a little while, we will all be safe."
nelves_23="Thank you, Lord El'rien. The hospitality of the North Elves is as generous as of your kin in the South! My men will help you hold out against our enemies."
nelves_24="Elf-friends, you have made it to safety!"

newtut2_10="Poisoned units lose hitpoints every turn until they are cured. 
The heal skill can only hold off the poison's effects for one turn.
You must use a village or a unit with the cure skill to eliminate the poison."
newtut2_11="A nice try, Konrad, but it seems your skills still have much to be improved."
newtut2_12="They caught me. You should have been more cautious."
newtut2_13="You have bested all your enemies, Konrad. Congratulations on your skill."
newtut2_2="Recall?"
newtut2_3="Soldiers that have fought for you in past battles - and survived - may be called again to serve you."

newtut2_6="I noticed that the bandits have the aid of some dark initiates and their undead minions."

If you can get your mages more experienced, they can be especially powerful."

tut1="It has been a great time here, Konrad. With our friends, the Elves, we have enjoyed many years in peace.

But you are no longer a child, Konrad. Every lord must learn the ways of battle, and gain the ability to lead his army against enemies of any race. Soon it will be time to replace your wooden training sword with one of iron, and to claim your inheritance. But there are things that you must learn before that."
tut15="This was only practice, Konrad, but remember that if it had been a real battle, you would now be dead."
tut16="Konrad, I did my best to stop them, but you were obliged to protect me as well. That is the end of training for today."
tut17="Indeed, Lofar, you were right. Humans can't lead armies."
tut18="Konrad! You should have helped me!"
tut19="Huh, human the leader! Wasn't telling you, Galdrad, it is waste of time?"
tut2="What must I learn, Delfador?"
tut20="Alright, Konrad. You were excellent today."
tut21="This young commander deserves the crown of Wesnoth. Let him be our hope for peace with Wesnoth, Lofar."
tut22="Congratulations, Human. Your performance today was impressive, I must admit."
tut23="A mission of a great importance is before us. Asheviere must not remain queen any longer!"
tut24="You did all the exercies, but four days was not enough for you to defeat bandits. I'm afraid you won't have so much time in real battle."
tut25="Do not be so cautious, Konrad. Go yourself to the fight, if there is no risk to your life."
tut26="You look miserable, Konrad. Four days have passed and you have not completed the exercises. In a real battle you must act quickly, before your enemies summon reinforcements. We will have to try again another time."
tut27="Go to the two villages near the river."
tut28="Now you have control over the majority of villages here. Well done!"
tut29="So far, so good, but we need more of them."
tut3="Before entering any battle, you need to hire soldiers. Gold is necessary for that. There are villages throughout the land. Those of which you gain control (marked with a red flag) will give you an extra gold coin every turn and thus pay the cost of one of your units. To gain control of a village, simply move any of your units there.
@EXERCISE
Go to the nearest villages, so that with the earned gold we can continue our lesson."
tut30="Excellent, human commander!"
tut31="Well, fighter is an excellent choice for every battle, but I would use archers here instead. They are better shooters than fighters."
tut32="Scouts are known for their horse riding. Here I would rather use archers, who can defeat the enemy before he is close enough to respond."
tut33="This task is complete!"
tut34="Archers are too weak to defeat poachers with swords. Attempting to attack one at a long range may be the last act of this archer's life!"
tut35="Well done!"
tut36="Now the last excercise. To continue, recruit some mages, so they can show you their skills."
tut37="Good work, Konrad!"
tut38="You are now a real commander, Konrad."
tut39="Thank you, Delfador. It wasn't so difficult as I had thought!"
tut3a="To move a unit first select it..."
tut3b=".. then select its destination.
If the destination is far away a unit may need more than one turn to reach it. The number shows how many turns it will take the unit to get there."
tut3c="After you are done with all the movements you need, click on the 'End Turn' button."
tut40="Now a real test of your commanding skills: in the castle north-east of ours, a bandit leader is preparing to take Elven land. Help Galrad defeat this evil leader.
There are also Elvish friends of ours who want to help you (use menu button and Unit List to find them).
You are now allowed to recruit all units. Good luck!"
tut41="You have recruited Scouts. Elvish Scouts aren't very good in combat although they can sieze large territories in a short time. They are excellent at capturing villages.
@EXERCISE
Take over the western villages to get more gold."
tut42="You have recruited Archers. Elvish Archers are weak in hand-to-hand combat, but are excellent shooters. Send your archers against enemies who don't have long range weapons and avoid leaving the forests and villages.
Archers advance to Marksman or Rangers, who are deadly with their long bows and swords.
@EXERCISE
We have prepared a practice target for you -- Gerlog, the thief, due south of your castle."
tut43="You have recruited Fighters. They are well prepared for combat in both close and long range. As all the Elves, they defend themselves well in forests and villages.
A Fighter's career ends at Marshal or Champion, both well prepared to fight against all types of enemies. Marshals can also lead soldiers in battle.
@EXERCISE
To test Fighters, send them against Kharhbrah, the Poacher on the brigde."
tut44="Horses are very fast on roads and grass. Therefore Horsemen have an advantage on that terrain."
tut45="Clearly, humans are less talented than the Elves. I'm doubful about usefulness of horsemen on the battlefield."
tut46="Horsemen advance to Paladins, great warriors who can also heal their companions in battle.
@EXERCISE
There is practice target on the clearing, south-east of your castle. Go there and wipe the area out of our enemies."
tut47="Humans are famous for their deep knowledge about the world. Mages are the elite of human researchers -- they are able to summon forces of nature and use them against any fool who would oppose them. Because of magic, their flaming missiles almost always hit the target.
Mages are physically weak. As they gain in experience, they specialize either in white magic as Mages of Light, or in other kinds of forces to become Great Mages.
@EXERCISE
On the other side of the road, Undead have spread. Make sure they don't move another step further!"
tut48="All right. In the next lesson, you will learn how to command horsemen. Now recruit some of them."
tut49="Chaotic creatures are stronger at night. Lawful ones are stronger at day. Neutral creatures' strength is not changed by daytime."
tut4a="To attack with a unit, first select it..."
tut50="Hurry up! You should have been here back a long time ago!"
tut51="What are you doing, Konrad?! One day has passed and you have not completed a single task!"
tut52="You should have completed the second practice. Make haste!"
tut53="Konrad, get on with it! They are not so many."
tut54="All right, but you're wasting too much time."

tut56="This is a simple task! Why are you performing so slowly!"

tut58="So far, so good, but hurry up! I have one more task to do for you."
tut59="You have too little time now, I must say."
tut5a="...then click to select a target.
Once you do this you have to choose the weapon."
tut60="Only eight turns left, Konrad."
tut_staff="This is my old staff. Although not very useful at close range, its magic may still prove deadly to your enemies. Its powers are waning, so it will not last long. Do not be afraid to use this weapon now - I will make sure you do not hurt yourself."
tut_staff2="Magic items could help you in your quest, but you should be aware that some items can only be picked up by certain units."
tutnope="You should complete your training before attacking the bandit leader."
tutorial_1="After they found refuge in the Elvish lands, the elder mage Delfador tried to teach the young Konrad all the skills and knowledge he would need to be a leader among his people."
tutorial_2="Meanwhile in the nearby woods, a group of dark preachers made an unholy pact with some desperate bandits."
undbook_1="Time marched on, and so did Gwiti. He was nearing the grove where he now knew the dreadful tome of Crelanu to be hidden."
undbook_10="A curse upon that necromancer! Why did he have to come here?!"
undbook_11="At last! This is it! Now I must laugh crazedly as a true villain always must!"
undbook_12="My lord, we have found the necromancer at last!"
undbook_2="I feel that it must be close. Could it be in that swamp?"
undbook_3="But the ancient mages had done their job well. The book had been hidden in a grove over which Elves and Orcs had waged war for many years, and any to approach would suffer their combined wrath..."
undbook_4="Oh no. The orcs seem to have recruited the undead to their side."
undbook_5="Blast it! However did the elves get a necromancer to march with them?"
undbook_6="I side not with either of you!"
undbook_7="The book is not here, but these swamps contain enough corpses to suit my purposes."
undbook_8="What? I can't die! Noooo!"
undbook_9="I die a terrible death... not knowing why."
undead_tower_10="Gack! This chest contains holy water!"
undead_tower_11="Look at what the mages were guarding!"
undead_tower_12="Those mages had hidden away more than it seemed!"
undead_tower_13="Two dozen gold. Plundering this tower is fun!"
undead_tower_14="A pile of assorted coins is here!"
undead_tower_15="Haha, this chest holds scores of gold coins!"
undead_tower_16="This is not the tome Crelanu wrote...hmmm... but it contains its whereabouts!"
undead_tower_17="We're done in here! Let's go slay some more enemies."
undead_tower_2="If my memory serves, this tower should have three floors. I should be able to find the Book in a few hours...!"
undead_tower_3="Hayaargghh! We have arrived! Command us, Master!"
undead_tower_4="There's a secret door here! This must be the library."
undead_tower_5="Well, well, well. Thirty-five pieces of gold were in this chest!"
undead_tower_6="Blast it, the chest is empty!"
undead_tower_7="Twenty pieces of gold is a welcome gift."
undead_tower_8="I suppose thirty copper coins should not be scorned..."
undead_tower_9="The chest is empty save for a few trinkets. The magic has gone out of them."
undeadbrother_1="Back in Wesnoth, the sun set on the first battle of the war being waged. But here another war brewed, between brothers."
undeadbrother_10="I...have failed to win this battle. I am defeated. I will not believe it."
undeadbrother_11="Die, yes, die, and go to the Land of the Dead. Perhaps one day you will be back under my command!"
undeadbrother_12="Didn't I tell you so?!"
undeadbrother_13="And by my own hands you died!"
undeadbrother_14="I am Gwiti the Mighty, prepare to die!"
undeadbrother_15="Now you shall die!"
undeadbrother_16="You miserable wretch, know that it is only by my mercy that you look upon the sun again, for you shall die before it sets."
undeadbrother_17="May I remind you that even as we speak, my undead legions are marching towards you?"
undeadbrother_2="Ah, hated brother mine. Look well upon the setting sun, for you shall not live to see another."
undeadbrother_3="I did not live to see this one either. I gave up my life for necromancy, same as you. Do you remember?"
undeadbrother_4="How well I do. But either way, prepare to die...again."
undeadbrother_5="I will fight you with all my strength to prevent that, and I was always the stronger of us. Flee now and save your miserable hide before I make it a carpet."
undeadbrother_6="Don't be silly! I'm not hairy enough to be a carpet! But your scalp would make a good pillow."
undeadbrother_7="What? I can't die! I already have! Noooo!"
undeadbrother_8="Ha ha ha, did I not tell you it would be so? Perhaps I shall summon your shade to serve me one day. Until then...farewell!"
undeadbrother_9="It is over. I am doomed..."
undeadmages_1="After sending the Dark Spirit away for his failure, Gwiti turned towards the Tower of Kaleon, where the greatest mages once studied."
undeadmages_10="Quirind, we have failed! You must guard the tower."
undeadmages_11="Ah ha ha ha! The tower's protective spells are now in force, you cannot enter without mastering a magic equal to it."
undeadmages_12="Haha! I have gained entry to the tower!"
undeadmages_13="A curse upon that foul necromancer!"
undeadmages_2="At last, I have reached the main road. Unless I am far off my course, I should find the Tower of Kaleon here, filled with the secrets of ancient mages. Soon they shall all be mine, and my power will be great enough to invade Wesnoth."
undeadmages_3="A necromancer approaches! I must send for aid."
undeadmages_4="Accursed and dreadful one, know that we mages, guardians of the Tower of Kaleon, shall bar your way with all our spells! Flee now and you may survive."
undeadmages_5="Quirind, know that you have the Elves at your back."
undeadmages_6="Foul sorcerer of death, go far from this place or we shall send you to your own realm."
undeadmages_7="Not born is the one that could challenge me!"
undeadmages_8="No! No! Noooo! It is over, I feel the shades reaching for me..."
undeadmages_9="Argh! I have fallen, and the Tower lies stripped of its defenses!"
undeadrise_1="After his banishment from Wesnoth for practising necromancy, the young Gwiti Ha'atel arrived on a strange land. He decided to claim it for his own."
undeadrise_10="The Wesnothians have discovered my escape! This is not good..."
undeadrise_8="Noooo! Not now, not when I have escaped!"
undeadrise_9="Argh! I die!"
undeadskull_1="After Gwiti destroyed his brother, he planned to march on Wesnoth to gain his revenge. But a Dark Spirit came to counsel him..."
undeadskull_10="It is not your banner, and it never was! That skull has marked it as mine since long ago."
undeadskull_11="Argh! This is only half of the skull!"
undeadskull_12="This skull is powerless!"
undeadskull_13="That is not the skull of Agarash!"
undeadskull_15="It's been a long time since I fought anything myself!"
undeadskull_2="Gwitiii...Gwiti!"
undeadskull_3="A Dark Spirit? Surely this is my token of mastery of the undead!"
undeadskull_4="Gwiti, do not yet march in pursuit of your revenge. First, you shall go south, against the orcs, and there find the Skull of Agarash."
undeadskull_5="What is the Skull of Agarash? Tell me more."
undeadskull_6="Do you see the three orc clans of this land? Their banners are topped with skulls, as is their custom. But one of these is the Skull of Agarash - which once was mine. Take it and your power will grow greater by far."
undeadskull_8="What? I can't die! I've done so already! Noooo!"

Knight="Ridder"
Knight_description="Ridderen er trænet i at bruge både lanse og sværd. Når han kæmper med lanse, galloperer han mod sine fjender, og derved både tager og modtager han dobbel skade."
Lich="Levende Lig"
Lich_description="Det levende lig er en troldmand, der fuldt ud er bundet til de mørke magter. For at kunne få kontrol over de levende døde har han ofret sin egen krop for selv at blive levende død. Dette giver ham evnen til at dræne livet ud af hans fjender ved en enkel berøring og til at kaste kraftfulde magiske kulde-formularer."
Lieutenant="Løjtnant"
Lieutenant_description="Udstyret med evner i sværdets og armbrøstens kunst leder løjtnanten små grupper af menneske-soldater og koordinerer deres angreb og øger de omkringstående lavere rangerende enheders kampevne."
Lord="Herre"
Lord_description="Herren er mange troppers velansete leder og er specielt stærk i nærkamp, men han holder også på gode evner med en bue. Ligesom kommandører har en herre leder-evner og forbedrer dermed alle lavere rangerende enheder på sideliggende felter."
Mage="Troldmand"
Mage_description="Troldmanden er svag og alligevel evnefuld. Han bevæger sig langsomt og er svag forsvarsmæssigt, men han angriber med magiske projektiler, der altid har en høj chance for at ramme deres mål.

Derfor er troldmanden et genialt valg, hvis man skal have nedkæmpet fjender, der skjuler sig i svært terræn."
MageofLight="Lysets Troldmand"
MageofLight_description="Lysets Troldmand er en af alle lovopretholdende troppers fantastiske allierede og er en frygtet modstander af kaosets magter. Troldmandens illuminerings-kræfter er så store, at han selv inklusive tropperne på felterne omkring ham faktisk aldrig oplever natten.

Når en enhed står ved siden af Lysets Troldmand, vil denne kæmpe, som hvis det var dag, når det er aften og som aften, når det er nat"

OrcishArcher="Orkisk Bueskytte"
OrcishArcher_description="Bueskytten anses af mange orker som en lavere kriger-kaste, fordi denne angriber sine fjender på lang afstand. Men da mange orker aldrig lærer, hvordan man bruger en bue, er han en uundværlig del af den orkiske hær."
OrcishAssassin="Orkisk Lejemorder"
OrcishAssassin_description="Selvom denne ikke er så stærk i kamp, er den Orkiske Snigmorder hurtig og kan forsvare sig selv godt i forskellige slags terræn, og han anvender gift på sine pile. Et offer, der er forgiftet, vil langsomt tage vedvarende skade, indtil han får mulighed for at stoppe i en landsby for at blive healet."
OrcishCrossbow="Orkisk Armbrøst"
OrcishCrossbow_description="Den orkiske armbrøst prøver at kompensere for hans manglende evner ved hjælp af råstyrken i hans våben. Selvom han ikke er så effektiv som den elviske jagtskytte i langdistance-kamp, så er han mere robust og kan klare sig selv lidt bedre i nærkamp."
OrcishGrunt="Orkisk Soldat"
OrcishGrunt_description="Den Orkiske Soldat udgør fundamentet af de orkiske kræfter. På trods af at de er langsommere end menneske- eller elver-krigere, kan denne soldat levere meget mere kraftfulde slag, og han kan modtage flere slag, før han falder."
OrcishSlayer="Orkisk Slagsherre"

OrcishWarlord="Orkisk Krigsherre"
OrcishWarlord_description="Kun orker med både et stærkt sind og uovertruffen styrke kan blive Krigsherrer. De er trænet i kamp både med sværd og bue, og disse kriger-bæster leder de orkiske kampgrupper."
OrcishWarrior="Orkisk Kriger"
OrcishWarrior_description="Da han mestrer sværdkampens kunst, er den Orkiske Kriger højt respekteret blandt orkerne og meget frygtet af sine fjender. Den eneste svaghed er den manglende evne til at anvende en bue."

De lavere rangerende enheder, der skulle befinde sig omkring prinsessen, vil kunne kæmpe bedre på grund af hendes tilstedeværelse. Prinsessen er også hurtig og smidig og har evner, der ligner en tyvs."
RedMage="Rød Troldmand"
RedMage_description="Den Røde Troldmand angriber med kraftige ildkugler, der med stor sandsynlighed rammer præcist. De kan kæmpe både nat og dag og er hurtige på fødderne, og en rød troldmand er værdifuld i stort set alle situationer"

choice11="Med den dybeste respekt, prinsesse, så tror jeg, at det bliver os, der vælger at undlade at slå nogen ihjel, om du så havde Scepteret eller ej. Jeg gentager endnu en gang: OS der undlader at slå DIG ihjel."

choice15c="Vi burde så sandelig søge tilflugt der, min herre, men ikke ved at følge vejen mod øst langs floden. Dens navn betyder 'Knoglefloden'. Store og ondskabsfulde skabninger ligger i skjul langs dens bredder. Dens vand kan ikke drikkes, og det flyder hen over Thoriaklipperne. Hverken menneske eller elver er nogensinde nået over disse klipper i live i et helt årtusind! Nej, prins, vi må vælge en anden vej."
choice15d="Hvilken vej skal vi så gå, Kalenz?"
choice15e="Der er to veje, vi kan gå, hvor vi kan undgå floden. Vi kan rejse mod nord gennem mit folks ældgamle hjem og så dreje mod øst, hvor mit folk lever nu, eller vi kan gå mod syd og igennem sumplandskabet og så mod øst og til sidst mod nord. Vi vil være nødt til at krydse floden en enkelt gang mere, hvis vi vælger den rute, men jeg kender et sikkert sted, hvor vi kan krydse den."
choice15f="Og vil du følge med os og søge tilflugt hos Nordelverne, prinsesse?"
choice15g="Hvis Elverne vil love mig tilflugt og sikre omgivelser, så er jeg villig til at følge med."
choice15h="Det vil vi, prinsesse. Selvom du er Dronningens, vores fjendes, datter, så vil vi ikke gøre nogen skade mod dig denne gang, for du har hjulpet os."
choice16="Vi er nødsaget til at gå mod enten nord eller syd, for vi er nødt til at komme væk fra denne dal. Og derefter vil vi kunne søge tilflugt hos de ældgamle Nord-Elvere."
choice2="Så du vil stadig kæmpe imod mig, prinsesse?"

intro_11="Da Delfador hørte om Ashevieres ordrer, sneg han sig ind på paladset og bortførte Konrad, den yngste af Garards nevøer, for derved at redde ham fra døden"
intro_12="Delfador tog barnet med sig ind i de vestlige skove og opdragede ham under Elvernes beskyttelse, mens han sørgmodigt så til, at Ashevieres forfærdelige kongedømme begyndte at brede sig over landet..."
intro_13="... men én af orkerne overlevede længe nok til at overbringe nyhederne til dronningen."
intro_2="Den Nordlige hær havde slået lejr ved Galcadar, ved Fort Abez, og kongen førte sine tropper ud for at møde dem. Han delte sin hær i to og kommanderede selv den ene halvdel, mens hans søn, Kronprins Eldred, kommanderede den anden."
intro_3="Eldred var en modig og frygtløs kriger, der havde gode leder-evner. Uheldigvis for Garard var han også ambitiøs..... og forræderisk. I kampens hede vendte Eldreds mænd sig mod deres konge. Garard blev dræbt i kampen denne dag sammen med hans bror og alle hans sønner bortset fra Eldred"
intro_4="Garard's dronning, Asheviere, så frydefuldt til, da hun var ankommet for at følge kampen fra en nærliggende bakke. Hendes søn måtte da klart regere på en måde, der tilfredsstillede hendes magtsyge, langt bedre end hendes mand havde gjort det."
intro_5="Den Nordlige konge sluttede gladeligt fred med Eldred i bytte for guld. Eldred erklærede sig selv konge og førte sin hær tilbage mod Weldyn."
intro_6="Men Garards ærke-troldmand, Delfador, havde undsluppet kampen og red hastigt til for derved at nå først til Weldyn. Han fik samlet en hær af loyale beboere til at kæmpe mod Eldred og hævne kongens død."
intro_7="Eldred trådte i kamp med hans moders klare råd i sit sind: Kæmp ikke mod nogen hverken store eller små bortset fra den gamle troldmand, hvis hoved skal kløves fra kroppen."
intro_8="Eldred mødte så sandelig Delfador ansigt til ansigt i kamp. Sværdet klingede mod staven. Den erfarne troldmand mod den unge, stærke, hårdføre kriger."

msg11_16="Konrad, mærk dig Delfadors ord, vi vender tilbage hertil senere, og så vil orkernes tag på landet blive løftet."
msg11_17="Jeg er ikke tryg ved dette, men jeg kan godt se, at vi bliver nødt til at skynde os."
msg11_2="Så kan vi ikke komme derind! Hvad skal vi gøre nu?"
msg11_2b="Vi kan ikke komme ind! Hvad skal vi nu gøre?"
msg11_3="Det siges, at orkerne brugte en gammel minetunnel for at overraske dværgene. Det må være den der mod nordøst."

msg12_11="Fred, venner! Fred! De onde Orker raser på landene over os, skal vi nu også slås blandt vore egne?"
msg12_12="Godt så! Hvem er du? Forklar da din tilstedeværelse her, menneske. Hvorfor har du risikeret liv og lemmer for at komme til Knalga, Dværgenes hjem?"
msg12_13="Tja, altså, vi....vi..."
msg12_14="Vi er kommet, for at en tronfølger kan gøre krav på sin arv. For at en konge kan gøre krav på sin trone. Vi søger Ildscepteret."
msg12_15="Ildscepteret? Er I blevet gale? Sandelig må I da tale i spøg!"
msg12_16="Vi spøger ikke, min ven. Vi søger Ildscepteret. Vi søger hjælp fra Dværgene til at finde det. I kan vælge ikke at hjælpe os, hvis det er, hvad I ønsker. Vi vil finde det med eller uden jeres hjælp."
msg12_17="Du taler som et fjols. Der er ikke engang nogen, der ved, om Ildscepteret overhovedet eksisterer. Hvem er denne arving, denne konge om hvem du taler, da?"
msg12_18="Det er mig, Sir."
msg12_19="Dig, haha, denne dreng, der står foran mig, skulle være kongen af Wesnoth? Haha! Jeg har ikke moret mig så meget i lang tid. Og hvem er du så, gamle mand?"
msg12_2="Ja, det er så sandelig mørkt. Vi må tænde nogle fakler og træde langsomt og varsomt. Forhåbentlig er der stadig nogle Dværge hernede, som kan hjælpe os!"
msg12_20="Jeg er Delfador. Delfador den Store, King Garards Ærke-Troldmand og hans arvings Protektor."
msg12_21="Du....du er Delfador? Jeg har set Delfador, da jeg kun var en ung Dværg, og jeg siger dig dette, gamle mand, du er ikke Delfador. Mænd! Fjern disse løgnere fra mit åsyn. Delfador døde for mange år siden."
msg12_22="Jeg er Delfador den Store! Enhver, der vover at stå imod mig, skal nedkæmpes!"
msg12_23="Du...du er virkelig Delfador! Men vi havde fået at vide, at du var død for mange år siden!"
msg12_24="De troede, jeg var død. De håbede, jeg var død. Men alligevel, alligevel overlevede jeg."
msg12_25="Og I tror virkelig, at I kan finde Ildscepteret?"
msg12_26="Ja, det gør vi. Hvis du hjælper os, min ven, vil alle Knalgas skatte, vi måtte finde, være dine. Vi ønsker kun Scepteret. Det vil være farligt. Tag endelig ikke fejl af dette: Nogle Dværge vil blive slået ihjel, måske endda mange Dværge. Men det er da sandelig bedre end at gemme sig for Orkerne som en flok orm."
msg12_27="Du har ret, min ven. Jeg vil lade mine bedste mænd være til din rådighed. Vi ved dog ikke, hvor Scepteret er. Legenden lyder, at det er skjult i de nordlige tunneler."
msg12_28="Jamen så tager vi afsted til de nordlige tunneler!"
msg12_29="Hmm... der ser ud til at være en hemmelig indgang bag disse sten!"
msg12_3="Ganske vist. Vi Elvere er ikke så godt trænede til sådan nogle mørke huler."
msg12_30="Der er store rigdomme i denne skattekiste! Jeg tæller to hundrede stykker guld!"
msg12_4="Dette er ikke så slemt. Da jeg voksede op i slottet, plejede jeg tit at udforske de hemmelige tunneler."
msg12_5="Hvem er disse, der er ankommet? Overflade-beboere! Til våben, mænd!"
msg12_6="Vi kommer med fred, venner. Vi kommer med fred!"
msg12_7="Nå, det gør I? Jeg kan se, at du endda er akkompanieret af Elvere. Kan vi Dværge ikke leve i fred uden, at de bedrageriske Elvere kommer for at forstyrre os?"
msg12_8="Hvorfor så fjendtligt-sindede ord, Dværg? Elvere har aldrig gjort jer nogen skade."
msg12_9="Aldrig gjort os nogen skade? Hvorfor så jeg så selv, da Elverne ikke kom for at ære vores alliance? Mange Dværge blev nedslagtet, og I kujonagtige Elvere gjorde ingenting for at hjælpe!"
msg13_1="Disse er nogle af de dværgiske hoved-huler."

msg13_7="RUMLE! RYSTE! BULDRE!"
msg13_8="Stenene bevæger sig!"
msg13_9a="Hvem der? Ven eller fjende?"
msg13_9b="Vi prøver desperat på at rydde disse tunneler for de fæle Orker! Hjælp os venligst med denne opgave."
msg13_9c="Ah, en fæl Ork! Lad os rydde disse tunneler for dens slags!"
msg13_9d="Jeg vidste ikke, at de levende døde var i disse huler!"
msg13_9e="Hvem er denne fæle fjende, vi kæmper imod?"
msg13_9f="Jeg er Lionel. Jeg er den Fortabte General. Jeg vil hævne mig på jer alle!"
msg13_9g="Hævne? Hvad har vi gjort mod dig, som fortjener at hævnes?"
msg13_9h="Lionel? En General? Jeg mener at kunne huske det navn..."
msg13_9i="Så du kan huske mig? Mm. Jeg var kongens fineste general, som blev sendt ned i disse huler for at genfinde Scepteret. Men Orkerne tog mig og mine mænd til fange i denne hule og lod os sulte ihjel. Dværgene var ikke til nogen hjælp, de lod mig bare dø. Nu vil jeg få min hævn over jer alle!"
msg13_die1="Argh! Jeg er besejret! Men i det mindste mod værdige modstandere i stedet for disse fæle Orker."
msg13_die2="Hvil i fred, Lionel. Den stakkels, fortabte general."
msg13_die3="På trods af at jeg er tilintetgjort, skal min mission fuldføres. Venner, Scepteret er videre nord for dette sted, dybt inde i grotterne. Jeg ønsker jer bedre held med at finde det, end jeg havde."
msg1_1="Fjorten år efter begyndelsen på Ashevieres rige vendte hun opmærksomheden på Elverne, som hun havde stor foragt overfor. Orkiske lejemordere blev hyret og sendt ud for at sikre Elvernes endeligt."
msg1_10="Lad dem bare komme. Vi vil kæmpe mod dem til det sidste!"
msg1_11="Vær forsigtig Konrad! Bevogt ham godt, Delfador!"
msg1_12="Og således begynder det"
msg1_13="Okay, vi har klaret det såvidt! Men hvor tager vi hen nu?"
msg1_14="Vi må rejse mod nord og prøve at klare den helt til Anduin-Øen. Forhåbentlig vil vi kunne søge tilflugt der."
msg1_15="Ja, det er rigtigt, Delfador. Men hvad skal der blive af Elverne her?"
msg1_16="Elverne vil slås. De vil muligvis endda klare den. Men jeg frygter, at det ikke ser godt ud for dem. Lad os ikke tale om dette nu. Afsted!"
msg1_17="Held og lykke Konrad! Du skal ikke bekymre dig om os, vi kæmper så godt, som vi kan!"
msg1_18="Jeg.... Jeg tror ikke, jeg kan klare den længere"
msg1_19="Prins... du må kæmpe videre! Neeeeeej!"
msg1_2="Mester Delfador! Se, der kommer Orker fra alle retninger! Hvad skal vi gøre?"
msg1_20="Det er slut, jeg er dødsdømt...."
msg1_21="Jeg har.... har fejlet i min pligt om at beskytte prinsen, jeg er overvundet"
msg1_22="Du må ikke dø! Delfador! Kom nu, du er nødt til at leve!"
msg1_23="Ugh"
msg1_24="h nej! Vi er løbet tør for tid, de er ankommet med forstærkninger..."
msg1_25="Dø, slyngel, dø!"
msg1_26="Kun et fjols står mod mig i kamp!"
msg1_27="Jeg er Galdrad. Hvis du vil videre, må du kæmpe med mig først!"
msg1_28="Du kommer ikke videre!"
msg1_28a="Jeg er Delfador den Store, forbered jer på at dø!"
msg1_29="Lad mig trampe dig ned, din usling!"
msg1_3="Der er for mange at kæmpe imod. Alt for mange. Vi er nødt til at stikke af!"
msg1_30="De ødelægger vores hjem!"
msg1_31="Der er ingen tid til at se tilbage. Vi må hurtigt tage afsted!"
msg1_4="Men hvortil? Dette er vores eneste hjem! Hvad med Elverne?"
msg1_5="Vi skal nok kæmpe mod fjenden, men du må slippe væk, Konrad. Det vigtigste er, at du slipper væk!"
msg1_6="Vi vil rejse mod nord. Måske kan vi nå Anduin-Øen. Hvis vi kan nå helt dertil, så må vi da være i sikkerhed. Konrad, vi skal rekruttére nogle Elvere til at hjælpe os, og så må du nå frem til skiltet mod nord-vest. Jeg beskytter dig!"

msg1_8="Angrib Elverne, mænd, tag deres landsbyer, lad os indtage dette land i dronningens navn!"

msg1b_13="Jeg har fejlet overfor Blackwater havne-folkene...."
msg1b_14="Uden hans hjælp er vi ude af stand til at bruge skibene, der er intet håb..."
msg1b_2="Delfador, nogle Orker følger vores spor! Vi må skynde os!"
msg1b_3="Delfador, min gamle mester, din ankomst giver os et lys af håb.
Vi hørte nyhederne om, at orkerne angreb de elviske skove, og at nogle af dem også tog herpå for at angribe os, men vores forsvar er stadig svagt."
msg1b_4="Vi vil hjælpe jer med at jage dem væk."
msg1b_5="Jeg skal lade en af mine troldmænd hjælpe dig. Rekruttér flere hvis du har behov for det.
Jeg har brug for et par dage til at hidkalde hjælp."
msg1b_5a="Jeg vil sende en af mine troldmænd ud for at hjælpe dig. Rekruttér flere troldmænd og eventuelt nogle hestetropper, som jo har kæmpet godt for os mod kronen. Jeg skal bruge nogle få dage til at skaffe hjælp."
msg1b_6="Det nye forsvar er nu ankommet."
msg1b_7="Uhh!! Der er for mange troldmænd, vi er nok nødt til at stikke af nu!"
msg1b_8="Tak for hjælpen, venner."
msg1b_9="Vi søger transport til Anduin-øen."
msg2_1="Og det skete at vores lille gruppe nåede Anduin-Øen..."
msg2_10="Har I ikke hørt det? Mange havmænd er taget til fange og bliver anvendt som perle-høstere ved Perlebugten. Hvis bare nogen ville komme dem til undsætning!"
msg2_11="Lad os da tage hen og redde dem!"
msg2_11b="Jeg håber bare, at vi vil klare os lige så godt, næste gang de onde Orker angriber os."
msg2_12="Herre, det ville være meget farligt..."
msg2_13="Jeg tror godt, vi kan klare det. Vi er nødt til at kæmpe mod Asheviere på en eller anden måde alligevel..."
msg2_14="Lad os tage videre, når vi har hvilet ud, så."
msg2_1_1="Da solen stod op over et land fjernt væk fra krigen, der foregik i Wesnoth, var en ny krig under frembrud, en krig mellem brødre..."
msg2_1_10="Jeg... har fejlet i mit forsøg på at vinde kampen, jeg er besejret. Jeg kan ikke tro det."
msg2_1_11="Dø, ja dø, og tag til de Dødes Land. Måske vil du en dag vende tilbage under min kontrol!"
msg2_1_12="Sagde jeg det ikke nok?!"
msg2_1_13="Og ved mine egne hænders kraft døde du!"
msg2_1_14="Jeg er Gwiti den Mægtige, forbered dig på at dø!"
msg2_1_15="Nu skal du dø!"
msg2_1_16="Din ynkelige slyngel, vid at det kun er ved min nåde, at du igen får solen at se, for du vil dø, før den står op på ny."
msg2_1_17="Må jeg minde dig på, at I dette øjeblik marcherer mine levende-døde legioner lige imod dig?"
msg2_1_2="Ah, forhadte broder min. Se længe på solopgangen, for du vil ikke leve længe nok til at se den igen."
msg2_1_3="Jeg levede skam heller ikke længe nok til at se denne. Jeg ofrede mit liv til fordel for åndemaneri på samme måde som dig, husker du det?"
msg2_1_4="Ganske vist jeg gør. Men under alle omstændigheder, forbered dig på at dø... igen."
msg2_1_5="Jeg vil kæmpe imod dig med al min styrke for at forhindre dette, og jeg har altid været den stærkeste af os. Flygt nu og red dit ynkelige skind, før jeg laver det til et tæppe."
msg2_1_6="Vær nu ikke fjollet! Jeg er ikke behåret nok til at blive et tæppe! Men din skalp ville kunne blive til en god hovedpude."
msg2_1_7="Hvad? Jeg kan ikke dø! Det er jeg allerede! Neeeej!"
msg2_1_8="Ha ha ha, sagde jeg ikke, det ville ende sådan? Måske skulle jeg hidkalde din ånd til at tjene mig en dag... Men indtil da, farvel!"
msg2_1_9="Det er slut, jeg er dødsdømt...."
msg2_2="Så dette er Anduin. Det ser lidt... øde ud"
msg2_3="Ja, det er jeg bange for, Konrad. Det ser ud til at Orkerne også har været helt herude"
msg2_3_1="Efter at have sendt den Mørke Ånd væk for sin fejl, vendte Gwiti opmærksomheden mod Kaleontårnet, hvor de største troldmænd engang studerede."
msg2_3_10="Quirind, vi har fejlet! Du må bevogte tårnet."
msg2_3_11="Ah ha ha ha! Tårnets beskyttende magiske formularer er nu sat i kraft, du kan ikke komme ind uden evnen til at mestre magiske kræfter af samme styrke."
msg2_3_12="Haha! Jeg har fået adgang til tårnet!"
msg2_3_13="Forband den fæle åndemaner!"
msg2_3_2="Endelig, jeg har nået hovedvejen. Med mindre jeg er helt på vildspor, skulle jeg finde Kaleontårnet her, fyldt med ældgamle troldmænds hemmeligheder. Snart vil de alle være mine."
msg2_3_3="En åndemaner! Jeg må sende bud efter hjælp."
msg2_3_4="Forbandede og frygtsomme du, vid at vi troldmænd, vogtere af Kaleontårnet, vil stoppe vejen for dig med alle vores trolddomskræfter! Flygt nu og du vil muligvis overleve."
msg2_3_5="Quirind, vær forsikret om at du har Elverne bag dig."
msg2_3_6="Uhumske dødsmagiker, tag langt væk fra dette sted eller vi vil tvinge dig tilbage til dit eget land."
msg2_3_7="Den, der kunne vise mig udfordring, er endnu ikke født!"
msg2_3_8="Nej! Nej! Neeeej! Det er slut, jeg fornemmer ånderne gribe ud efter mig..."
msg2_3_9="Argh! Jeg er faldet, og tårnet ligger uden forsvar!"
msg2_4="Hvem har vi her? Ah, en gruppe elvere er ankommet, vi vil tvinge dem tilbage til havet!"
msg2_5="Jeg havde ikke troet, at Orkerne ville komme helt hertil. Denne ø plejede at være så smuk. Vi er nødt til at genindtage den! Til angreb!"
msg2_6="Hjertelig velkommen, venner, jeg takker jer for at redde min ø fra Orkerne!"
msg2_7="Det var vores pligt, min ven. Jeg håber, du vil lade os søge tilflugt her indtil videre"
msg2_8="Selvfølgelig. Orkerne er brutale. Brutale. Specielt det, de gør mod de stakkels havmænd."
msg2_9="Øh, hvad gør de mod havmændene?"
msg3_1="Så dette er Perlebugten. Det ser ud til, at de har sat havmændene i hårdt arbejde!"
msg3_10="Men... men... hvordan kan det ske for mig?"
msg3_11="Hvem var den idiot?"
msg3_12="Endelig fri! Nu bringer vi død over Orkerne!"
msg3_13="Nu hvor vi er frie, vil vi sammen nedkæmpe vores undertrykkere!"
msg3_13a="Død over orkerne! Kom, lad os nedkæmpe dem, mænd!"
msg3_14="Frihed! Hvor er de Orker nu? Lad mig få fat på dem!"
msg3_15="Tak fordi du reddede os! Nu kan vi hjælpe dig i kampen mod de onde Orker!"
msg3_16="Endelig, vi har befriet havmændene. Tag tilbage til havet og forlad os i fred."
msg3_17="Herre! Du har nok i fremtiden brug for nogle af vores skabning, da du kan bruge vores gode evner på havet. Vi tilbyder dig vores hjælp og tager med dig."
msg3_18="Hvor er Delfador nu? Jeg håber, han er OK!"
msg3_19="Så sandelig jeg er, min ven."
msg3_2="Ja, det gør det ganske vist. Det ser også ud til, at de har mange, mange tropper. Jeg tror, jeg tager omkring bugten og leder noget af deres opmærksomhed væk. Du og resten af vores mænd vil redde havmændene!"
msg3_20="Der er du! Jeg er så glad for, at du har klaret den! Nu har vi tid til at hvile lidt."
msg3_21="Jeg er bange for, at der ikke er tid til at hvile. Konrad, Asheviere angriber lige nu Elensefar og bryder den århundrede-gamle traktat mellem Wesnoth og Elense by-staten. Hvis byen falder, er det forfærdeligt at tænke på, hvor mange andre lande, hun kan opsluge!"
msg3_22="h nej! Hvad kan vi gøre?"
msg3_23="Du må føre vores mænd frem til byen og prøve at hjælpe med at forsvare den - eller generobre den, hvis den falder, før du ankommer."
msg3_24="Skal JEG gøre det? Men hvad med dig, Delfador? Du følger da med mig, ikke?"
msg3_25="Desværre ikke, Konrad. Jeg er faldet over nogle vigtige dokumenter, og jeg må hurtigt få dem bragt til det Elviske Råd. Det ser ud til, at vi har mindre tid til at stoppe Asheviere, end jeg havde troet."
msg3_26="Men Delfador! Jeg kan ikke klare det på egen hånd!"
msg3_27="På egen hånd? Herre! Vi, dine loyale soldater, vil støtte dig!"
msg3_28="Du skal nok klare det. Jeg tror på dig. Rejs mod nord. Elensefar er kun tre dages rejse herfra, hvis du skynder dig."
msg3_29="Godt så. Vi ses ganske sikkert igen, min kære ven!"
msg3_29a="Udmærket. Men hvordan kommer jeg til Elensefar?"
msg3_3="Fint nok. Vær forsigtig!"
msg3_30="Farvel, prins."
msg3_30_farewell="Jeg ønsker dig en sikker rejse, Konrad. Indtil vi ses igen!"
msg3_30_farewella="Hav en sikker rejse, Konrad. Må solen skinne på jer."
msg3_30a="Det er mod nordvest, blot nogle kilometer fra kysten. Der er to måder at komme derhen på, med skib eller over landjorden. Hver vej har sine egne farer og fælder. Du må selv vælge, hvordan du ønsker at komme derhen."
msg3_31="Har du ikke kunnet overvinde vores fjender igennem alle disse dage? De har tilkaldt forstærkninger. Nu må vi da sandelig være dødsdømte!"
msg3_32="Konrad! Vi kan ikke spilde mere tid her. Selvom det dog ville være godt at besejre Orkerne og befri alle dem, vi kan, så er der vigtigere sager, der kalder!"
msg3_33="Delfador, gudskelov at du har overlevet! Det har været en hård kamp, men hvorfor kan vi ikke færdiggøre den? Hvorfor skal vi tage afsted igen?"
msg3_34="Jeg har dårlige nyheder: Asheviere har angrebet Elensefar og brudt traktaten mellem Wesnoth og Elensefar. Du skal føre vores mænd til byen for at hjælpe med at forsvare den -- eller generobre den, hvis den falder i fjendens hænder, før du når frem."
msg3_35="Og det skal jeg gøre? Men du følger da med mig, gør du ikke, Delfador?"
msg3_36="Det er jeg bange for, at jeg ikke gør, Konrad. Jeg har fundet nogle vigtige dokumenter, der skal ses på. Jeg må ride afsted omgående for at holde råd med Elverne. Vi vil mødes i Elensefar, efter du har sikret byen."
msg3_37="Jeg frygter, jeg vil komme til at kæmpe hårdt for at kunne klare dette selv, men det, der skal ske, skal ske. Hvordan kommer jeg til Elensefar?"
msg3_38="Eftersom du har brudt Orkernes herredømme over havene, ville det være sikrest at rejse med et skib. Sejl langs kysten og du vil kunne lægge til land kun nogle kilometer fra Elensefar. Fart på!"
msg3_39="Så længe Orkerne har herredømmet over havene, ville det ikke være sikkert at rejse med skib. Rejs på landjorden, Elensefar er kun seks dages vandring op ad kysten. Fart på!"
msg3_4="Men chef, hvorfor bruger vi kun flagermus og nagaer?"
msg3_5="Fordi vi er nødt til at have kontrol over havene og havfolket, og nagaer og flagermus er bedst til at klare dette!"
msg3_6="Men orker er den stærkeste race i hele..."
msg3_7="Klap i, orm! Jeg er chefen!"
msg3_8="Hahaha! Nu vil orkerne regere over både land og vand!"
msg3_9="(Suk) er der nogen, der vil myrde den idiot for mig?"
msg4_1="Men vejen til Elensefar var forræderisk. Konrad og hans mænd blev angrebet af de levende dødes soldater."
msg4_10="En lille overraskelse! Jeg leder efter troldmænd, og alt, jeg får, er elvere!"
msg4_11="Dette tempel ser ud til at være tomt."
msg4_12="Det har været en ære at hjælpe dig med at overvinde de levende døde, herre. Nu må jeg rejse hjemad igen."
msg4_12a="Det har været os en ære at hjælpe dig med at besejre de levende døde, min herre. Nu må jeg vende tilbage til mit hjem. Jeg fornemmer, at vores veje vil krydses igen en dag, måske når du har endnu mere brug for hjælp mod de levende-døde hære."
msg4_12b="Sejren er vores! Lad os bare håbe, at denne forsinkelse ikke vil stoppe vores forsøg på at redde Elensefar. Vi må fremad hurtigt!"
msg4_2="Herre! Der er noget, der bevæger sig i de gamle ruiner!"
msg4_3="Det ser ud til, at der er levende døde der! Forbered jer på kamp, mænd!"
msg4_4="Til angreb!"
msg4_5="Ahh, en gruppe Elvere ankommer. Snart har vi Elviske zombier iblandt os!"
msg4_6="Der er nogle forhistoriske templer mod nord-vest. Jeg undrer mig over, hvad der er inde i dem!"
msg4_7="Det ser ud som om, at nogen skjuler sig i templet."
msg4_8="Jeg gemte mig på dette hellige sted, mens jeg planlagde, hvordan jeg skulle nedkæmpe de onde levende døde, og nu kan vi sammen tilintetgøre dem."
msg4_9="Det ser ud som om, at nogen skjuler sig i templet."
msg4_moredie="Kæmp videre mod de levende døde uden mig, venner!"
msg5_1="Gruppen ankom endelig ved Elensefar men måtte sande, at byen allerede var faldet til de onde Orker."
msg5_10="Tyve, hmmm? Hvem siger, vi kan stole på jeres slags?"
msg5_11="Vi kan selvfølgelig forstå det, hvis I ikke stoler på os, men det er i vores begges interesse at drive Orkerne ud af byen!"
msg5_12="Meget vel, I kan slutte jer til os."
msg5_12a="Hmm...Jeg vil overveje dette..."
msg5_13="Endelig, vi har genindtaget byen! Lad os hvile her, venner."
msg5_14="Vi har sejret! Elensefars tyve står til Deres tjeneste, herre"
msg5_15="Vennerne hvilede i tre dage, efter hvilke en gammel bekendt vendte tilbage"
msg5_16="Vær hilset, mine venner. Jeg ser, at I har reddet byen! Jeg vidste, I kunne klare det."
msg5_17="Delfador! Godt at se dig! Hvor har du været?"
msg5_18="Jeg har haft et møde med det Store Elverråd. Dette er Kalenz, en herre fra de Nordlige Elvere, som kom til Rådet for at tilbyde os de Nordlige Elveres støtte"
msg5_19="Vær hilset, ven."
msg5_2="Herre! Det ser ud til, at byen allerede er faldet til de overlegne magter!"
msg5_20="Delfador, vi har indtaget denne by, men Ashevieres mænd vil da med sikkerhed komme og angribe os! Hvad skal vi gøre?"
msg5_21="Rådet har mødtes, og vi har besluttet: Vi må finde Ildscepteret"
msg5_22="Ildscepteret? Hvad er det?"
msg5_23="Under Garard I's regeringstid, din onkels far, accepterede dværgene fra Knalga at lave kongen et fantastisk scepter. Det tog deres fineste smede år at lave det. Men kort efter det blev færdiggjort, invaderede Orker Knalgas tunneler. Nu er Knalga i kaos, og selvom nogle dværge stadig lever i nogle af dets egne, konstant i krig med Orkerne, er sceptret gået tabt et sted inde i de gigantiske huler."
msg5_24="Aha, men hvad har det med mig at gøre?"
msg5_25="Garard II, din onkel, var ved at overveje en efterfølger. Han lavede en ed om, at det royale familie-medlem, der kunne få Ildscepteret tilbage, skulle regere landet."
msg5_26="Aha, og du vil have mig til at finde dette scepter?"
msg5_26a="Vi vil hjælpe dig med at få fat i det, herre."
msg5_27="Vi har ikke meget tid. Vi tror også, at Asheviere leder efter sceptret for at hjælpe med at holde på hendes plads som hersker. Men dog, hvis du finder sceptret først, så vil folket støtte dig som deres konge."
msg5_28="Mig? Deres konge?"
msg5_29="Ja, Konrad. Jeg tror på, at du bliver konge en dag. Men nu må vi skynde os afsted!"
msg5_3="Dette er forfærdelige nyheder! Vi må genindtage byen!"
msg5_4="Der er så mange af dem. Det her bliver ikke nemt! Og se mod syd, det ser ud til, at de levende døde er allierede med Orkerne!"
msg5_5="Der kommer Elverne! Med vores nyligt formede alliance med Orkerne vil vi nemt knuse dem!"
msg5_6="Vi må indtage byen og tilintetgøre de onde levende døde, før deres forstærkninger ankommer!"
msg5_7="Midt om natten kryber tre mørke figurer ud af skoven"
msg5_8="Holdt! Hvem er der? Ven eller fjende?"
msg5_9="Vær hilset, ven. Vi kommer fra Elensefars Tyve-Forening. Vi vil hjælpe jer mod Orkerne!"
msg6_1="På vej mod Knalga blev vores helte mødt af Ashevieres soldater"
msg6_10="Holdt! I kommer ikke videre!"
msg6_11="Min ordre er at slå dig ihjel!"
msg6_12="Kom væk!"
msg6_13="Beskyt mig!"
msg6_14="Ja, madam!"
msg6_15="Stop lige der!"
msg6_16="Bliv væk!"
msg6_17="Stop lige der!"
msg6_18="De kæmper sig igennem alt for hurtigt! Jeg må heller tage magiske midler i brug."
msg6_19="Nu har de også indtaget DEN landsby! Jeg skal få dem til at flygte!"
msg6_2="Dronningen har beordret mig til at stoppe dig, din bedrager!"
msg6_20="Hvis sværd ikke kan slå dem ihjel, så kan magi måske."
msg6_21="Rist dem!"
msg6_22="I får betaling for at slå dem ihjel, så se at komme i gang!"
msg6_23="En eller anden! Dræb disse bedragere, nu!"
msg6_24="Uggh, vil slå de småfolk ihjel!"
msg6_25="Ogrer! Jeg må have flere ogrer til at nedkæmpe dem!"
msg6_26="En ogre må da kunne knuse dem!"
msg6_27="Jeg overgiver mig! Du må ikke gøre mig noget, din bedrager."
msg6_28="Jeg sagde før, at jeg IKKE var en bedrager, men hvis du overgiver dig, så vil jeg lade dig leve."
msg6_29="Lad mig gå!"
msg6_3="Det er prinsessen, Li'sar. Dronningen adopterede hende, og det rygtes, at hun opdrager hende til at være hendes efterkommer!"
msg6_30="Tænk på historien om den gamle konge, spørg en gammel person om den."
msg6_31="Den gamle konge? Jeg har hørt om ham, men jeg ved, at det ikke er sandt. Det har min moder fortalt mig."
msg6_32="Din moder har løjet for dig, mit barn. Nu foreslår jeg, at du tænker lidt over det og enten slutter dig til os eller flygter i eksil. Der vil snart være en stor krig, og hvis du er på den forkerte side af denne, så får vi nok ikke muligheden for at skåne dit liv en anden gang."
msg6_33="Jeg er ikke et barn, og jeg vil ikke tale om det! I sagde, I ville skåne mit liv, så se at komme videre. Den nordlige vej skulle være sikker for jer."
msg6_34="Fortsat god dag, prinsesse. Følg mig, mænd, ad den nordlige vej!"
msg6_35="(hæhæ, de ved intet om, hvor mange levende døde der har gået ad den nordlige vej på det seneste. De er i sandhed dødsdømte!)"
msg6_36="Nej! Det kan ikke ende på denne her måde!"
msg6_37="Argh! Jeg er blevet overvundet!"
msg6_38="Uden Kalenz er det hele håbløst. Vi har allerede tabt kampen."
msg6_4="Jeg er ikke en bedrager, det ser ud til, at din moder har løjet for dig om dette."
msg6_4b="Forræderi! Dine løgne vil gå i døden sammen med dig!"
msg6_5="Det nytter ikke noget at prøve at bringe hende til fornuft. Der er kun én ting, hun vil forstå. Til angreb!"
msg6_6="Det her tager for lang tid, jeg må hellere kalde på forstærkning!"
msg6_7="Måske brugte jeg ikke nok tropper..."
msg6_8="Beskyt prinsessen!!!"
msg6_9="Stop!!!"
msg7_1="Herre! Denne vej ser ikke så sikker ud, som vi havde håbet på. Se omkring os på bakkerne, der er levende døde i området!"
msg7_10="Pyha! De ser endelig ud til at stikke af!"
msg7_10a="Solen står op i øst. De levende døde kan da ikke have kraften til at fortsætte deres nedslagtning i endnu en dag!"
msg7_10b="Bestemt ikke! Jeg fornemmer, at vi har overlevet denne kamp."
msg7_10c="Pyha! Det var en hård kamp, men endelig er de på flugt!"
msg7_11="Ja! Vi har tvunget dem væk"
msg7_12="Men, hvorfor løj du for os og fortalte os, at denne vej var sikker for derefter at komme og redde os, unge pige?"
msg7_12a="Dette sted giver mig myrekryb, selvom de levende døde er på flugt. Hvor kan vi gå hen nu?"
msg7_12b="Tak fordi du vendte tilbage for at hjælpe os, Moremirmu."
msg7_12c="Det bedrøver mig meget, at Moremirmu faldt i kamp, efter han var vendt tilbage for at hjælpe os."
msg7_13="Tja, jeg øhh... altså efter I havde overvundet mig, ønskede jeg bare jer allesammen døde, men så følte jeg mig pludselig skyldig og besluttede mig for, at jeg nok hellere måtte hjælpe jer!"
msg7_13a="Landet Wesnoth er ikke sikkert for os. Dronningens magt når hvert eneste hjørne. Vi må skynde os til de nordlige lande på den anden side af den store flod. Lad os komme afsted hurtigt!"
msg7_13b="Det er både min pligt og fornøjelse, min herre! Vi nød et måltid med nogle af prinsessens royale vagter og holdt et hvil fra vores lange rejse, alt imens de talte om, hvordan du blev narret til at rejse gennem disse farlige lande. Vi kunne ikke gøre andet end at hjælpe jer!"
msg7_13c="Må han hvile fredfyldt!"
msg7_14="Og hvor er alle dine mænd?"
msg7_14a="Så sandelig! Lad os tage væk herfra!"
msg7_14b="Aha, hun narrede os med vilje til at tage denne vej! Hvor kan vi tage hen nu? Hvilken vej vil være sikker for os?"
msg7_14c="Han døde, mens han kæmpede for dig, prins, præcis som enhver af os ville være rede til at dø for dig."
msg7_15="Tja, jeg forlod dem! Jeg listede væk med nogle få af mine mest loyale mænd. Jeg har besluttet mig for, at jeg ikke vil efterkomme min moder. Hun ville gladeligt have ladet jer allesammen dø, men jeg indså, at jeg bare ikke kunne gøre dette."
msg7_15b="Du må slippe væk fra den onde dronnings greb, min herre. Hvis du sætter kursen mod nordøst forbi griffernes bjerg, vil du kunne klare dig over den store flod ved Abez. Men du må dog skynde dig, for du vil ikke kunne komme over floden, når vinteren kommer!"
msg7_16="Og vil du så slutte dig til os nu?"
msg7_16b="Tak for dit råd, gode ven! Må vores veje mødes igen i gladere stunder!"
msg7_17="h, må jeg godt, sir?"
msg7_18="Ja, det må du, mit barn."
msg7_19="Det ser ud til, at vi er færdige her. Vi må fortsætte vores pilgrimsfærd!"
msg7_2="Hvem er disse, der nærmer sig? Lad os dræbe dem alle!"
msg7_20="Jeg kan ikke tro på, at det skal ende sådan!"
msg7_21="Argh! Jeg er færdig!"
msg7_22="Nej! Enden er nær! Vi er blevet overvundet!"
msg7_3="Til angreb, mænd! De levende døde er på vej mod os!"
msg7_4="Der er virkelig mange! Hvad i himlens navn skal vi gøre?"
msg7_5="Vi må bare holde dem tilbage så lang tid, som vi kan!"
msg7_6="Jeg er kommet for at støtte jer, venner!"
msg7_6b="Jeg er endnu engang kommet for at hjælpe jer, venner!"
msg7_7="Hvad i alverden laver du her?"
msg7_7b="Hvide troldmænd? Kommet for at hjælpe os? Men hvad laver de her?"
msg7_8="Tænk ikke over det nu! Lad os tvinge de levende døde væk!"
msg7_8b="Det er Moremirmu! Han hjalp os i kampen mod Muff Malal, lad os håbe han kan hjælpe os endnu engang!"
msg7_9="Vi er også kommet for at hjælpe. Da prinsessen fortalte os om din store nød mod de levende døde, ville vi tilbyde vores hjælp."
msg8_1="Dette er det berømte Grif-Bjerg! Måske hvis vi kan fange nogle grif-unger eller få fat i nogle af deres æg, så kan vi træne dem til opsadling, så vi kan flyve på dem!"
msg8_1a="Hvad er dette for et sted? Det er et højt bjerg!"
msg8_2="Herre Konrad, vi er nødt til at være meget forsigtige. Det kan være meget farligt at forstyrre disse monstre i deres reder."
msg8_2b="Det er det sagnomspundne Grifbjerg! Vi skal være forsigtige her, det kunne vise sig at være farligt at forstyrre grifferne."
msg8_3="God idé, Konrad! Jeg elsker at flyve!"
msg8_3b="Så dette er Grifbjerget! Måske kunne vi stjæle nogle æg fra grifferne og opdrætte dem som flyvende ridedyr? Ville det virke, Delfador?"
msg8_4="Okay, allesammen, lad os gå i gang med at klatre op ad det bjerg."
msg8_4b="Vi kan da prøve at gøre det, selvom det så sandelig kan være farligt! Men måske kunne brugen af griffer være os til stor hjælp senere. Vi er under alle omstændigheder nødsaget til at rejse herigennem."
msg8_5="Fjolser, vi kunne overfalde dem, mens de kæmper mod monstrene."
msg8_5b="Jamen lad os start med at klatre op af det bjerg!"
msg8_5c="Det ser ud til, at vi ikke er de eneste, der er interesserede i dette bjerg. Endnu engang står Dronningen i vejen for os!"
msg8_5d="Hurtigt, mænd! Fremad!"
msg8_6="Vi har overvundet dem! Hvad gør vi nu?"
msg8_7="Vi må fortsætte mod nord. Det er for sent at vende tilbage til Elensefars eller Anduins sikkerhed, før vinteren falder omkring os. Så derfor må vi krydse den store flod og fortsætte mod Dværgenes land. Kom, lad os gå!"
msg8_8="Med disse grif-æg skulle vi være i stand til at yngle griffer, der kan adlyde os. Dette vil lade os hyre grif-riddere!"
msg8_9="Fremad, mænd!"
msg8_9b="Lad os fortsætte fremad!"
msg9_1="Dette er Fort Abez. Det er her, din fader og onkel blev forrådt og dræbt. Det er næsten nitten år siden nu, Konrad."
msg9_10="Det fjols slog sig selv ihjel."
msg9_11="Hvad mener du, Delfador?"
msg9_12="Jeg samlede mænd til at kæmpe mod forræder-kongen og selvfølgelig Asheviere, der stod bag det hele. Vi var i undertal, muligvis fire til én. I kampens hede kom den dumme dreng løbende mod mig og slog vildt omkring sig. Jeg havde intet andet valg end at gøre det af med ham."
msg9_13="Så det er altså sandt, at du var den, der dræbte ham?"
msg9_13b="Så det er sandt, at du dræbte ham?"
msg9_14="Ja, han døde ganske vist i kamp mod mig. Det er trist, at Konrads fire brødre ikke havde muligheden for at opleve sådan en 'ærefuld' død."
msg9_14b="Han døde sandeligt i kampen, for min hånd. Det er trist, at dine brødre ikke havde muligheden for at opleve en sådan 'værdig' død, Konrad."
msg9_15="Okay, hvad skete der med dem?"
msg9_16="Med al respekt til mine herrer, vi må skynde os. Vi er nødt til at krydse floden nu. Se! Det ser ud til, at vagttårnene på flodbredden er bevogtede!"
msg9_17="Hvem er disse, der prøver at krydse floden? Vi er nødt til at stoppe dem, mænd!"
msg9_18="Er der ikke et andet sted, vi kan krydse floden? Måske længere oppe ad floden?"
msg9_19="Vinteren vil hurtigt være over os. Vi har kun få dage til at krydse floden, og den nærmeste bro er langt oppe ad floden. Det ville være det rene selvmord at være strandet syd for floden, når vinteren kommer. Asheviere ville slå os ihjel som rotter! Vi må krydse her."
msg9_19a="Hvem er det, der prøver at krydse floden? Efter dem, mænd! Lad dem ikke nå over!"
msg9_19b="Der er de! Så er det sandt, de har stoppet de levende døde. Nu prøver de at forlade Wesnoth. Vi må ikke lade dem krydse floden. Efter dem, mænd!"
msg9_2="Er det rigtigt? Hvad skete der egentlig, Delfador?"
msg9_20="Kom, lad os gå!"
msg9_20a="Ikke hende igen! Hurtigt, vi må skynde os!"
msg9_3="Kongens hær havde slået lejr her. Den nordlige hær havde slået lejr på den nordlige side af floden. I tre dage and tre nætter stod hærene overfor hinanden, og ingen af dem var villige til at krydse floden. På den fjerde dag krydsede de nordlige hære floden og angreb os."
msg9_4="Og hvad skete der så? Hvem vandt?"
msg9_4b="Og så.... blev vi besejret?"
msg9_5="Vi så ud til at vinde kampen. Vi holdt dem tilbage."
msg9_6="Lige indtil kongens søn, midt i kampens hede, lige indtil han vendte sig mod kongen!"
msg9_7="Ah, og så.... dræbte du prinsen, ikke Delfador?"
msg9_7b="Men du hævnede mordet. Du slog prinsen ihjel, ikke, Delfador?"
msg9_8="Da jeg så kongen forrådt og så hans banner falde, flygtede jeg fra kampen. Hvadenten det var visdom eller fejhed flygtede jeg fra kampen, da jeg kunne se, at der ikke var håb for os den dag."
msg9_9="Men min moder... Dronningen, hun fortalte mig altid, at du slog min bror ihjel, Sir"
msg9_9b="Åh, men Elverne har altid fortalt mig, at du slog prinsen ihjel, Delfador, selvom du aldrig talte om det."
msg9_a1="Ruaarrrrrrrr!"
msg9_a2="Hvad var det?"
msg9_a3="Dybets skabninger er over os! Dette kan være meget farligt. Hurtigt, vi må se at komme over på den anden side så hurtigt, vi kan!"
msg9_a4="Vi er nået sikkert over floden! Hvor går turen hen nu?"
msg9_a5="Vi må fortsætte mod nord. Vi må prøve at få hjælp fra de nordlige Dværge, hvis vi skal have et håb om at bryde ind i Knalga."
msg9_a6="Jeg kan ikke tro det, de er nået væk! Vi må skynde os efter dem. Efter dem, mænd, lad os også krydse floden! Vi vil mødes igen, fæle bedrager."
msg9_a7="Tror du virkelig, hun vil følge efter os, Delfador?"
msg9_a8="Det ser sandelig ud til, at hun vil forsøge, men havets skabninger vil gøre det svært for hende. Vi må fortsætte fremad. Hvis hun når hele vejen over inden vinter så lad det være så!"
msg_delfador_die="Nej! Her slutter det hele! Vi er blevet overvundet!"
msg_doors_lisar="Pyha! Vi klarer os gennem bjergenes farlige tåge, og nu er der dette kaos foran os! Kom, mænd! Vi må nå ind i minerne, for de er stadig foran os!"
msg_get_gold_swamp="Du stjæler 100 stykker guld fra liget!"
msg_kalenz_die="Argh! Jeg er færdig!"
msg_konrad_die="Vi er fortabte, for jeg er besejret!"
msg_lisar_die="Jeg kan ikke tro på, at det skulle ende sådan!"
msg_nw_8="Der falder mere sne. Vi må gøre en ende på denne kamp hurtigt. Fremad, mænd!"
msgcrossroads1="Bliv på ruten! Skovene her er ikke sikre!"
msgcrossroads2="Tag jer i agt for skoven! Der gemmer sig mange Orker der, og de er klar til at overfalde jer!"
msgcrossroads3="Her er vi nået til det store vejkryds. Vi skal gå mod nordøst."
msgcrossroads4="Pas på! Disse skove er ikke sikre! Asheviere har lejet Orker til at bevogte disse veje på grund af deres strategiske vigtighed. Vi er nødt til at slås for at komme forbi her."
msgcrossroads5="Jamen så lad os slås! Sæt i gang."
msgcrossroads6="Sejren er vores, mænd. Lad os fortsætte nordøst!"
msgnw_1="Denne vinter er bidende kold! Måske skulle vi gøre holdt her og hvile lidt."
msgnw_10="Og da, efter mange dages hvil, fortsatte vores flok endnu engang sin rejse mod Dværge-riget..."
msgnw_2="Gøre holdt og hvile? Min herre, vi er nødt til at træde raskt til for at nå Ildscepteret, hvis det ikke skal falde i hænderne på vores fjender!"
msgnw_3="Vi har kæmpet os igennem en hård march, lige siden vi blev angrebet af de levende døde i den fæle dal. Nu er vinteren på vej over os, og vi har brugt de fleste af vores penge. Dette land ser frodigt nok ud, vi kan da vel bosætte os her vinteren over!"
msgnw_4="Ja, lad os hvile et stykke tid! Jeg er vis om, at der er mange udfordringer forude, og jeg tror ikke, jeg i mange dage kunne udholde endnu flere udfordringer på linie med at nå over den flod."
msgnw_4b="Ja, lad os hvile lidt! Jeg er sikker på, der er mange udfordringer forude, og jeg tror ikke, jeg i mange dage kunne udholde endnu en udfordring på linie med at nå over den flod."
msgnw_5="Vi er på jagt efter Ildscepteret, rigets skæbne er i vores hænder, og i mennesker vil stoppe og hvile? Fremad, siger jeg!"
msgnw_6="De har ret, Kalenz. Jeg havde forventet at få fat i det scepter inden for en måne, men sådan skal det ikke være. Vores soldater vil begynde at desertere, hvis vi ikke hviler snart. Men i disse vilde nordlige lande må vi kæmpe for bare at få retten til at hvile. Se mod nord! Disse fæle orker vil ikke tillade os at hvile i fred!"
msgnw_7="Jamen så vil vi flå kontrollen over landet ud af hænderne på dem. Til våben, mænd!"
msgnw_8="Sejren er vores! Vi har sikret landet for Orkerne. Nu kan vi hvile her, mens den kolde vinter er over os."
msgnw_9="Lad os dog ikke hvile for længe, venner. Vi skal stadig nå de ældgamle dværgiske lande, før vores fjender når dem."

msgsnowplains1a="Disse snemarker var engang mit folks hjem. Vi rejste videre for århundreder siden. Legenderne lyder på, at der blev efterladt et storslået ildsværd."

nelves_10="Vær hilset, Eonihar, gamle ven! Hvorfor har du ledt efter os?"
nelves_11="Da min herre fik nys om jeres ankomst, sendte han spejdere ud for at finde jer! Der er fare på færde. Fra syd kommer Wesnoths mænd og leder efter jer, og mod nord står Orkerne parat til at kæmpe imod dem!"
nelves_12="Hvordan tør disse Wesnoths mænd at marchere ind på vores jord. Kom, mægtige Orker, vi vil tvinge dem tilbage i den store flod, hvorfra de kom!"
nelves_13="Det er ikke sikkert for jer her i åbent landskab. I må skynde jer mod øst, ind i skoven. Prøv at nå frem til Eretria hvor min herre venter jeres ankomst. Allerede nu forbereder han en gruppe Elvere til at komme og sikre jeres ankomst."
nelves_14="Hver hær er én hær for meget for os at kæmpe imod. Kom, vi må skynde os mod skoven! Lad Orkerne og Menneskene kæmpe mod hinanden, mens vi venter."
nelves_15="Vær hilset, Elver-ven! Velkommen til Eretria. I må søge tilflugt her, indtil kampen er ovre. Bliv her hos mig lidt længere, og vi vil være i sikkerhed."
nelves_16="Tak, fyrst El'rien. Nordelvernes gæstfrihed er lige så god som hos dem mod syd! Mine mænd vil hjælpe jer med at klare den mod vores fjender."
nelves_17="Elver-venner, I er nået i sikkerhed!"
nelves_18="El'rien, vi har Ildscepteret med os! Vi må eskortere dem til Elensia!"

nelves_2="Efter at have været i dette vildnis i så lang tid, skal det blive godt at hvile ud!"
nelves_3="Men se mod syd! Der er en hær af mænd. De bærer Wesnoths banner!"
nelves_4="Der er de endelig! Vi er kommet hele vejen hertil for at stoppe dig, din forbryder!"
nelves_5="Asheviere har sendt flere mænd efter os. Det er modigt af dem at komme så langt, og det ser ud til at være en stor hær."
nelves_6="Og jeg vil tro, at du vil være på deres side, ikke, prinsesse?"
nelves_7="Jeg er en ærefuld prinsesse, ikke en ussel slyngel! Jeg gav jer mit ord på, at jeg ville være allieret med jer, indtil vi undslipper fra disse forbandede nordlige lande, og jeg vil holde mit ord!"

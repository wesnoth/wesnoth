Though you are foes, you are at least worthy ones, so I will tell you that the Scepter is east from here, the way you have come from, deep in the caverns.

msg_cmpgn_ei_01_02="Since we have no will of our own, we must agree with you."
msg_cmpgn_ei_01_03="No! We must hold this outpost!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_01_04="Sir, we cannot hold out forever. I am going to search the castle and see if there is any way we can escape and warn the King."
msg_cmpgn_ei_01_05="Sir! We can escape from here now! I have found a trapdoor next to the castle!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_01_06="Follow me, men! Through the trapdoor!"

msg_cmpgn_ei_02_04="Who goes there?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_02_05="We are travelers loyal to the king of Wesnoth. Will you help us escape these trolls?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_02_06="Yes, we will help you, for although we have no loyalty to Wesnoth, we believe that you are on a noble quest."
msg_cmpgn_ei_02_07="There is a great fortune in this chest of treasure! I can count two hundred pieces of gold!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_02_08="We have found you, human- Prepare to die!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_02_09="They follow us. We must move quickly!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_02_10="We have reached the end of the escape tunnel. I see daylight above us."
msg_cmpgn_ei_03_01="We have escaped from those dark tunnels! But where are we now?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_03_02="Oh no! We are in the middle of enemy territory!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_03_03="Hahaha! We have you surrounded!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_03_04="Why don't we see if the new recruit can handle them. After all, there are only two!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_03_05="No!!! They'll kill me!"

msg_cmpgn_ei_03_07="It seems Mal-Tar is weak, but his brothers are still surrounding us. I propose we kill him and use his castle as a base for our attack!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_03_08="If we kill Mal-Skraat, we will have opened a way to enter Wesnoth, but if we kill Mal-Kallat, we will be able to penetrate further into Undead lands."
msg_cmpgn_ei_03_09="No! You have defeated me, and can re-enter Wesnoth!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_03_10="You have defeated my brother, but I will follow you and kill you!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_04_01="Greetings, travelers! Welcome to my realm."
msg_cmpgn_ei_04_02="Hello. I am wondering if you can help he fight these undead beasts that attack us."
msg_cmpgn_ei_04_03="Certainly. Although we will not leave our forests, we will help you reach the northern outpost, where the Lieutenant stationed there may aid you."
msg_cmpgn_ei_04_04="Intruders!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_04_05="What? Those pesky orcs! They are the intruders, not us!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_04_06="They are right in the Northern Path. We will have to fight them to move on."
msg_cmpgn_ei_04_07="Bring forth the assassins, we may be able to poison them!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_04_08="Your Warlordship, I am the only assassin left! Do you want me to go poison their leader?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_04_09="Perfect! Go, into the forest!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_04_10="They have sent an assassin into the forest. We will have to be careful, and make sure he does not come out and attack us unexpectedly."
msg_cmpgn_ei_04_11="Hahaha! Nafga will kill the elves!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_04_12="No! This is the first time I have failed a mission, and it is my last!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_04_13="My assassin is dead! the elves must pay, not for his death, but for stopping him in his mission!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_05_01="We have reached the borders of the undead land. Surely you do not mean to go forward- we will all die if we do! We should turn North and help Owaec, captain of the Northern Outpost, hold off the undead."
msg_cmpgn_ei_05_02="I am not yet sure. Whether we go forward or backward, we will have to fight. The necromancer Mal-Skraat has chased us."
msg_cmpgn_ei_05_03="They run from me! Still, it will not help them, the border patrol will destroy them. I may even be promoted!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_05_04="Now I will never get promoted!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_05_05="Come, let us return to Wesnoth and aid the Northern Outpost."
msg_cmpgn_ei_05_06="We have defeated this patrol, but we can still turn back! Do we want to go further into these lands now, or do we want to try to turn back and defeat this necromancer?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_05_07="Hmm..."
msg_cmpgn_ei_05_08="We do not want to waste time here fighting Mal-Skraat. Onward!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_05_09="I will not say if this is a good decision, but I will follow you."
msg_cmpgn_ei_05_10="Noo!!! I can't be promoted if they run away!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_05_11="You are right. It is foolish to go onward- we must defeat Mal-Skraat and turn back, going to the Northern Outpost."
msg_cmpgn_ei_05_12="Good! if I defeat them, I can become a lich!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_05_13="We failed to defeat either enemy! Now more lichs will come, and we will be overwhelmed!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_05_14="We cannot spend any more time defeating Mal-Skraat. Like it or not, we must go further into these undead lands."
msg_cmpgn_ei_05_15="Noo!!! He will reach Mal-Ravanal's capital, and I shall be punished for letting him escape!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_06_01="Hail, Gweddry!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_06_02="Hello. We have been forced from our positions. Do you think you can help us regain our outpost?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_06_03="I am not sure. There are bandits in this country, and it is they who rule this land, not the king. My men are afraid of them, and refuse to come out and fight. As you see, though I have many men, they stay penned up in the keep. The thieves hide in the villages."
msg_cmpgn_ei_06_04="We will see if we can get across to where you are without thieves killing us. Also, we will try to go to the villages and drive the thieves out. Onward, men!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_06_05="Stop these intruders from getting through. Ambush them!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_06_06="We have defeated these bandits. Perhaps, now that we are here, Owaec's troops will not be afraid to exit his castle."
msg_cmpgn_ei_06_07="Yes, hopefully. Our outpost has been overrun by undead. What about yours? Have you encountered them?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_06_08="No, I have not encountered any undead yet. However, I don't think me and my men can do any more good here. We will come with you to see if, together, we cannot find a way to push back these undead."
msg_cmpgn_ei_06_09="Hahaha! I have found you, pesky humans! Prepare to die!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_06_10="Oh no! The undead have come, and we have not had time to prepare for them! We will all die now!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_07_01="We have came all the way to Mal-Ravanal's Capital!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_07_02="Yes, but look! The undead forces are closing in behind us. We cannot kill Mal-Ravanal. We must turn back!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_07_03="True. We must kill one of these necromancers that follows us to retreat. Still, I think we have done some good here: these enemies are delayed by our actions."
msg_cmpgn_ei_07_04="These humans have dared to come this far into my land. Crush them!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_07_05="You dare to attack ME?!? Go back to your master!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_07_06="Thank you for destroying that skeleton warrior! Every time you kill one of the advanced skeletons, one of my ally knights is let free!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_07_07="Why? Are you the undead's prisoners?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_07_08="Yes. My allies and I were questing when we were ambushed by undead. The guard is playing a sick game- whenever one of their warriors dies, one of us is let free, but whenever you lose a fighter, they kill one of us."
msg_cmpgn_ei_07_09=" This sounds like a dangerous game. We will try to free as many of you as possible before we escape from here."
msg_cmpgn_ei_07_10="There are five of us still locked up in the jail. All of us will join you if you can get us free."
msg_cmpgn_ei_08_01="Look! The road splits here. Which way shall we go?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_08_02="I know this area. I was here on an earlier patrol. Just north of here there is a river that leads to the northlands, where orcs live. To the east lies the mountains, then the undead lands."
msg_cmpgn_ei_08_03="We should probably go north to the orcish lands and try to circle around and catch the undead by suprise."
msg_cmpgn_ei_08_04="No, I think we should go straight into the undead lands. Strike hard and fast!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_08_05="Either way we will have to fight. Look, the orcs and undead are fighting each other, and block our path!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_08_06="Well, orc, we can either continue this fight, or we can crush there pesky humans and battle later. Your call."
msg_cmpgn_ei_08_07="Hm... I know. We will make a pact to destroy these humans, and continue our fight later. (hopefully you will die, for then I will win our battle by default.)"
msg_cmpgn_ei_08_08="Very well, we are allies, for now. (this foolish orc will surely die)."
msg_cmpgn_ei_08_09="No! These undead has won our battle, and you will be able to enter my northern homeland!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_08_10="You have entered my master's country! He will not be pleased about this."
msg_cmpgn_ei_09_01="We have come to a great river. What should we do? Should we attempt to cross it?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_09_02="We must cross this river. The undead are chasing us. Reinforcements for the undead will arrive soon. we must be across the river before that happens."
msg_cmpgn_ei_09_03="Across this river lies the Northland. If we can get there, we may be able to get some ogres to help us."
msg_cmpgn_ei_09_04="Grug say we no help you! We finish must battle orc with!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_09_05="And in Wesnothish that means?..."
msg_cmpgn_ei_09_06="Orc foolish! Die you now!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_09_07="I think the ogres are trying to kill the orcs."
msg_cmpgn_ei_09_08="If we show ourselves as enemies of the orcs, they may help us. But I think we should cross the river before trying to convince these ogres to help."
msg_cmpgn_ei_09_09="The undead reinforcements have arrived! We must cross the river immediately!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_09_10="Good! We have crossed. Now let's see if we can get the Ogres to join us. They have been convinced to work for the Crown in the past; maybe it can be done again."
msg_cmpgn_ei_09_11="Grug say join you maybe he."
msg_cmpgn_ei_09_12="Hurry up. We need to get across before these undead slaughter us!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_10_01="Look- here is a large river. Should we attempt to cross it, or turn back?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_10_02="We must cross this river. It is said that Ogres live north of here, and we must enlist their aid if we are to defeat the undead. The undead realize this, that is why they have sent a Lich to block our path."
msg_cmpgn_ei_10_03="Across this river lies the Northland. Yes, Ogres live there, but so do Orcs, who will try to stop us. We should proceed with caution."
msg_cmpgn_ei_10_04="I will leave your bodies to rot in the river, then I will raise you up to serve in my Master's undead hordes!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_10_05="I summon from the depths of the river those beasts which will destroy you!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_10_06="It seems as if in addition to summoning undead this Lich has learned to call up demons!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_11_01="Look, we have found a pack of Ogres. Lets see if we can capture some to train."
msg_cmpgn_ei_11_02="Alright, we have to keep at least two of these Ogres on the grass until our troops get here to capture them."
msg_cmpgn_ei_11_03="We should try to surround them. Gweddry, you stay where you are. Dacyn, you go north-east. I'll go north-west."
msg_cmpgn_ei_11_04="We have let one escape. Lets hope they all don't!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_11_05="Good! We have managed to capture some Ogres. We can now recruit them into our army."
msg_cmpgn_ei_11_06="We didn't capture enough of the ogres here. We will have to go on without them."
msg_cmpgn_ei_12_01="Hail, Dwarves! Will you help us defeat these foul Orcs?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_12_02="You human! Call us foul, will you?!?!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_12_03="Why should we help you? You're not a dwarf!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_12_04="Your people helped us in the past, in the tunnels in the South. Why won't you help us now?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_12_05="Impossible! I can't believe any of my comrades would have helped a human!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_12_06="Indeed. Why should any of us help those not in our tribe?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_12_07="Will you at least let us pass in safety?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_12_08="I am afraid that is now impossible."
msg_cmpgn_ei_12_09="Orcs, kill'em all! Humans, elves or dwarves, it don't matter!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_12_10="These orcs will die. But so will you, human. You have tresspassed on Elvish land."
msg_cmpgn_ei_12_11="Oh, elvish land is it now? Die, you elf-dog! And you too, human!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_12_12="These people won't listen to reason, they are blinded by their own races supposed superiority!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_12_13="True. As much as I dislike killing anything that is not evil, it seems we will have to kill these elves, and these dwarves, before they kill us."
msg_cmpgn_ei_12_14="Argh! I'm dead! well, dwarves are still the best!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_12_15="I die? Orcs rule all!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_12_16="It seems these darn humans are more powerful than I though. Ugh."
msg_cmpgn_ei_13_01="The trail stops soon. Look at this- mountains block our path."

msg_cmpgn_ei_13_04="Then let us go. Onward!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_13_05="This bridge is kind of rickety..."
msg_cmpgn_ei_13_06="This bridge is going to collapse soon! Quick, across the river!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_13_07="Ah! The bridge collapsed!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_13_08="Everyone who is across the river, onward! Everyone else, try to go around the lake!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_13_09="What? Now there is no way across! We will have to go around the lake."
msg_cmpgn_ei_13_10="Good! We have made it to the end if the road. We can now get out of these mountains."
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_01="Why have you entered my lands?!?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_02="We were traveling-"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_03="Silence! Did I ask you?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_04="Um..yes."
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_05="Shut up! Thats it! I'm putting you in the high-security cave!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_06="Ugh..."
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_07="Huh? Where am I?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_08="It looks like I'm in some sort of prison..."
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_09="I think I will have to escape, and rescue Dacyn and Owaec."
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_10="So you are in this cell! Come on, we have to escape!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_11="Very well. I think the rest of the cells are further down this path."
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_12="So, they must have captured $R2.user_description in addition to Dacyn, Owaec and me. Well, $R2.type, follow me. We have to get out of this dungeon."
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_13=" It is nice to have a $R1.type among us! My guess is $R1.user_description will be able to shoot these devils without them doing anything about it, since most orcs are melee."
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_14="Dacyn! Good, now we can try to escape. Do you know any way to get out?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_15="No, but I think I can be of some help. I think I have found out where the key to the door is!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_16="Really? Where?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_17="The wall of the northern part of my cell, and right outside of it, is thinner than everywhere else. I think there isa hidden door there. Come, let us see!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_18="Here is the thin spot. Actually- wait a second- its not a thin spot at all! Its really a door!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_19="Huh! A guard. Lets see how quickly we can kill it."
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_20="I have found the key! Lets get out of here!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_21="This is the right key! Lets open the door, quick!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_22="The high security prisoners are escaping!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_23="Kill them."
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_24="The guards are distracted! Now is the time to escape!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_25="What the...? Who said that?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_26="The guards are planning to execute us tomorrow! Please help us!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_27="Hah! Tomorrow? You make a big mistake if you believe you will live that long."
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_28="Right, boss, especially since they're invading, and we need to kill them now before they escape!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_29="Argh! Oh well, at least my vast hordes will defeat you!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_30="Good! We have escaped these accursed caves, and can reunite with our army!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_14_31="Thank you for rescuing me! I will help you on your quest, whatever it is."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_01="Welcome to Weldyn, Gweddry! Unfortunately we cannot give you as great a welcome as you deserve."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_02="Thank you, my King Konrad II."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_03="Well, yes, us being here is all well and good, but there are undead hordes pressing up against our gates. Now what are we going to do about that?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_04="We need to fight them. Look, night approaches- they will soon attack. I hope we can hold them off."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_05="I will hold my gate. With my quick and skillful warriors I can resist the undead, at least for a while."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_06="Yes, and my people may be slow, but their blows are the most powerful of all. I can hold my post."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_07="Archers are the most powerful fighters of all, as they shall prove in the upcoming battle."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_08="Peace, my sons! We are fighting the enemy, there is no need for rivalry within our camp."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_09="In any case, the undead are attacking now. Let us hope we can last out the night."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_10="No! These undead have defeated me!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_11="And now we will revive you to serve us, as an undead Knight!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_12="Time to defeat these pesky humans, in my new body."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_13="No! I have been defeated! I only hope the undead do not raise me to fight against you!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_14="Oh, don't worry, we will. Mwahahahahaha!!!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_15="Well, my one-time father, let us see who will last out the night!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_16="Its difficult to defeat these undead. It will be much easier to join them."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_17="Huh?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_18="You idiot, I'm defecting!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_19="You traitor!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_20="Yes! Now my victory is assured!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_21="Come, my warriors, let us defeat this foolish King!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_22="I don't think so! Our loyalty is with the King!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_23="I have died, and with me the city shall fall."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_24="Now I shall be the king of the undead Wesnoth!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_25="Look, the sun has risen. The undead are retreating."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_26="Well, you have defeated some of my captains. Good job. But that was only a small fraction of my horde."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_27="What is your point?"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_28="Well, it would be very easy for me to defeat you. But I don't think it would do justice to my power."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_29="We don't care about honoring your power. Bring it on!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_30="Shut up, fool. I meant my own power, not the power of my legions. And that brings me to my second point. You, Gweddry, as a commander, are a coward."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_31="What, me, a coward!?! Why!?!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_32="Yes, you, a coward. You claim to have defeated my captains, but it was really your hordes, not you."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_33="Hordes is a name used for undead. We prefer to call ourselves an army."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_34="Silence, fool! The point is that Gweddry could not have defeated my minions without the help of his slaves!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_35="I'm not a slave! And YOU'RE the fool!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_36="SHUT UP! I doubt Gweddry could even last two seconds in actual combat. And I'll prove it. I challenge you, Gweddry, to a duel."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_37="I'm not going to fight you in one-on-one combat!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_38="That only proves you are a coward. Anyway, who said anything about one-on-one combat? I said a duel, six-on-six. Pick your five best slaves and I will pick my five best minions."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_39="That is a very interesting notion of a duel. Gweddry, I suggest you accept, since he keeps calling you a coward."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_40="No, don't accept. It is obviously a trick- he will bring many more than five people. We must win this battle on our own terms."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_41="I'll make it simple. Accept, or face the onslaught of my hordes, like the coward that you are."
msg_cmpgn_ei_15_42="Hmm..."
msg_cmpgn_ei_death_dacyn="Wesnoth is doomed! Without me, Gweddry has no hope!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_death_gweddry="No! I have failed in my mission to save Wesnoth from destruction!"
msg_cmpgn_ei_death_owaec1="My outpost has fallen..."
msg_cmpgn_ei_death_owaec2="ugh."
msg_orc10_50="At the saurians! Rip them to the last!"
msg_orc10_51="It is too late, we are defeated."
msg_orc_11_1="So here we are, they are preparing to assault."
msg_orc_11_10="And if we fail?"
msg_orc_11_11="Then they will assault Prestim at five versus one.  We'll just have to pray mother earth."
msg_orc_11_12="Great."
msg_orc_11_13="Then, the battle for Prestim began."
msg_orc_11_14="We arrive to honor our alliance, Earl Lanbec'h."
msg_orc_11_2="Prestim's walls are rock hard, they' ll break clean off on them."
msg_orc_11_20="Here we are!  Hold on Prestim, we arrive to push them to the river!"
msg_orc_11_21="They are too numerous now, RETREAT !"
msg_orc_11_22="The defense of Prestim you've done is heroic, facing such opposition surely undermined morale of humans.  Now they are retreating to their fortresses and won't get out of them."
msg_orc_11_23="It is now time to show them who we are and to lead the Great Horde to their tails!  They won't have a rest untill we'll destitute Earl Lanbec'h!"
msg_orc_11_24="Kapou'e will come back in Son of the Black Eye chapter II, 'The Great Horde'."
msg_orc_11_3="I'm not that sure.  Every fortress has its own weakness.  Prestim's wall are built on three towers.  If one of them is destroyed, a breach will allow humans to enter Prestim ... needless to say, this would be the end for us."
msg_orc_11_4="I've received messengers from the Council, saying that they are regrouping tribes into the Great Horde."
msg_orc_11_5="Great!  When do they arrive?"
msg_orc_11_6="In four days minimum.  I fear it will be too late."
msg_orc_11_7="I don't think so, there is still a way.."
msg_orc_11_8="Which one?"
msg_orc_11_9="Most of forces will cross the river by the ford where the bridge where previously.  If we manage to defend it, we might still have a chance."

tip_of_day="Tip of the Day"
tip_of_day1="Lawful units fight better at day, and chaotic units fight better at night. Neutral units are unaffected by day and night."
tip_of_day10="Units that do not move or attack during their turn rest, and will recover 2 hitpoints at the beginning of their next turn."
tip_of_day11="Most foot units defend better in villages and castles than in most other terrain, while most mounted units don't get any defensive advantage in villages and castles."
tip_of_day12="Horse based units are generally resistant to attacks with bladed or impact weapons, but are vulnerable to attacks with piercing weapons, including bows and spears."
tip_of_day13="Inflicting the killing blow on an enemy unit is the best way to gain experience. Units killing an enemy will gain 8 experience for every level of the unit they kill."
tip_of_day14="Elvish units move and fight very well in forest. Dwarvish units move and fight very well in hills and mountains."
tip_of_day15="Patience is often key. Rather than attacking in bad conditions, or with few troops, wait for better conditions and then attack."
tip_of_day16="If you are attacked from several directions, it may be a good idea to send expendable units in some directions to delay enemy units."
tip_of_day17="Do not be afraid to retreat and regroup, it is often the key to victory."
tip_of_day18="In most campaigns you will receive a gold bonus for finishing early, depending on the number of villages on the map, and the number of turns you finish early. You will always earn more gold this way than through capturing villages and waiting for turns to run out."
tip_of_day19="Your leader can recruit or recall units from any keep inside a castle, not just the keep they start on. You can capture a keep from an enemy and recruit from there. Also, some of your allies may be willing to make room for you on their keep so you can recruit there."
tip_of_day2="In a campaign, you can use veteran units from previous scenarios by using the 'recall' option."
tip_of_day20="Skeletons are resistant to piercing and bladed attacks, but vulnerable to impact, fire, and holy attacks."
tip_of_day21="Units with leadership ability make lower level adjacent units on the same side fight better."
tip_of_day22="Generally avoid moving next to an unoccupied village. An enemy unit may move onto the village and attack you, while enjoying the defense and healing of the village."
tip_of_day23="Holding the mouse cursor on an ability or trait shows a description of that ability or trait."
tip_of_day24="Use lines of units to screen injured units to let them recover."
tip_of_day25="Read the hotkeys list in the preferences menu."
tip_of_day26="If you move a unit, but don't attack or discover any additional information, you can undo your move by pressing 'u'."
tip_of_day27="You can see how far enemy units can move by moving the mouse cursor over them."
tip_of_day28="Use healers to support your attacks - they will win you battles without needing to attack anything themselves."
tip_of_day29="The 'slow' attack ability makes enemy units move slower, but it also gives them one less attack than they would normally have. It is thus very effective against units that have a few powerful attacks."
tip_of_day3="There are six types of attacks: pierce, blade, impact, fire, cold, and holy. Different units have weaknesses against different types of attacks. Right-click on a unit, and then select 'Unit Description', and then click 'Resistance' to see how much resistance a unit has against different attack types."
tip_of_day30="Holy attacks are very powerful against undead."
tip_of_day31="Units are healed when they advance a level. Used wisely, this can turn a fight."
tip_of_day32="Charging units are best used against enemies they can kill with a single blow."
tip_of_day4="The terrain your units are on determines the chance your opponents have of hitting them in battle. The defensive rating for the currently selected uni in the currently selected terrain is displayed in the top-right corner of the screen."
tip_of_day5="Poisoned units lose 8 hitpoints every turn, but they will not die from poison: poison will never reduce them below 1 hitpoint. Poisoned units can be cured by moving them to a village, or placing them next to a unit with the 'cure' ability."
tip_of_day6="You can use units from a previous scenario by selecting 'Recall' by the game menu. By recalling the same units over and over, you can build up a powerful and experienced army."
tip_of_day7="All units have a Zone of Control in each of the hexes next to them. If a unit moves into an enemy's Zone of Control, it may not move any further that turn."
tip_of_day8="The chance to hit a unit usually depends on how well that unit can defend itself in the terrain it is standing in, however magical attacks always have a 70% chance to hit, and marksman attacks have at least 60% chance to hit."
tip_of_day9="Units stationed in villages heal 8 hitpoints at the beginning of their turn."

choice1="Jeg takker dig for at have hjulpet mig tilbage til overfladen, men nu vil jeg tage, hvad der retmæssigt er mit!"
choice10="Nej, jeg tænkte bare.... og jeg har ikke rigtig lyst til at slå dig ihjel. Jeg har jo, hvad jeg kom efter. Hvad med at du lover mig aldrig at komme syd for den store flod, mod at jeg undlader at slå dig ihjel?"
choice11="Med den dybeste respekt, prinsesse, så tror jeg, at det bliver os, der vælger at undlade at slå nogen ihjel, om du så havde Scepteret eller ej. Jeg gentager endnu en gang: OS der undlader at slå DIG ihjel."
choice12="Det var noget af et sprogbrug i kongelig tilstedeværelse! Ønsker du at blive stegt levende, Elver?"
choice13="Venner, fred! Selvom vi er nået ud af tunnelerne, er vi næppe i sikkerhed. Vi befinder os i de tørre, vilde nordiske lande. Vi ved knap nok, hvor vi er. Skuer vi mod nord, ser vi orker. Og se mod syd, der er mørke hære. Vi er nødt til at holde fred mellem hinanden, ellers vil vi alle dø"
choice14="Jeg formoder, at vi alle vil have fordel af at hjælpe hinanden et stykke tid endnu. Men hvad skal vi gøre? Hvordan skal vi forsvare os selv?"
choice15="Vi må foretage et valg. Mod nord, hinsides Orkerne er sne-ødemarkerne. Mod syd, hinsides de Levende Dødes hære er Frygtens Sump."
choice15a="Jeg kan sige dig, hvor vi er. Ved floden, der af mennesker er kendt som Longlier, men som Arkan-thoria på mit folks ældgamle sprog. Mit folks hjem ligger mod øst."
choice15b="Så skulle vi måske tage mod øst langs floden og søge tilflugt og hvile der for en stund?"
choice15c="Vi burde så sandelig søge tilflugt der, min herre, men ikke ved at følge vejen mod øst langs floden. Dens navn betyder 'Knoglefloden'. Store og ondskabsfulde skabninger ligger i skjul langs dens bredder. Dens vand kan ikke drikkes, og det flyder hen over Thoriaklipperne. Hverken menneske eller elver er nogensinde nået over disse klipper i live i et helt årtusind! Nej, prins, vi må vælge en anden vej."
choice15d="Hvilken vej skal vi så gå, Kalenz?"
choice15e="Der er to veje, vi kan gå, hvor vi kan undgå floden. Vi kan rejse mod nord gennem mit folks ældgamle hjem og så dreje mod øst, hvor mit folk lever nu, eller vi kan gå mod syd og igennem sumplandskabet og så mod øst og til sidst mod nord. Vi vil være nødt til at krydse floden en enkelt gang mere, hvis vi vælger den rute, men jeg kender et sikkert sted, hvor vi kan krydse den."
choice15f="Og vil du følge med os og søge tilflugt hos Nordelverne, prinsesse?"
choice15g="Hvis Elverne vil love mig tilflugt og sikre omgivelser, så er jeg villig til at følge med."
choice15h="Det vil vi, prinsesse. Selvom du er Dronningens, vores fjendes, datter, så vil vi ikke gøre nogen skade mod dig denne gang, for du har hjulpet os."
choice2="Så du vil stadig kæmpe imod mig, prinsesse?"
choice3="Troede du virkelig, at det her bare var en leg for mig? Jeg er nødt til at tage min arv!"
choice4="Det er ikke så enkelt! Vi er tilbage på overfladen, men vi er dog ikke i sikkerhed. Vi ved knap nok, hvor vi er, og se der mod nord! Der lusker orker rundt omkring! Se mod syd, der er horder af levende døde!"
choice5="Det er der så sandelig. Vi er nødt til at kæmpe os ud herfra. Er du med os, prinsesse, eller imod os?"
choice6="Måske er det i vores begges bedste interesse, hvis vi forbliver allierede lidt længere. Men jeg vil have det Scepter, og jeg skal nok få det en dag!"
choice7="Så må vi lave en kampplan."
choice8="Tja, vi kom ud i live."

council_1="Greetings, and welcome to our capital. You should feel honored. It has been half a century - a generation in the way your race counts time - since any man has been considered Elf-friend enough to stand here."
council_10="I had no idea! Thank you, my lady. It is a pleasure to meet you again."
council_11="Rescued him from my mother? But nineteen years ago Konrad would have been an infant! What is this you are talking about?"
council_12="Your mother has much blood upon her hands, child. She has had many killed unjustly. When Konrad was an infant, she ordered all the princes put to death, so she could sieze control."
council_13="She had them murdered? There were others too, not just Konrad? Surely you do not speak the truth! Parandra, what do you say?"
council_14="Princess, when Delfador the Great speaks of the Queen Mother, Asheviere, ordering the princes of Wesnoth to be put to death, he speaks the truth."
council_15="And what say you, Elf-king?"
council_16="I did not see it myself, Princess, but I have heard many reliable reports. Asheviere indeed has the blood of the princes on her hands. She has also allowed Orcs to desecrate the lands, abandoning all respect for the peoples around her."
council_17a="Well, that is why I must take the Scepter. I will return, and people will accept me as Queen. I will rule justly and fairly. My mother is only Queen Mother. The throne is rightfully mine, and with the Scepter I can prove it."
council_17b="Princess, there is some good in you, but the throne is not yours to claim. Konrad has the Scepter. He will take the throne."
council_17d="Well, I have the Scepter! I will return and the people will accept me as Queen! My mother is only Queen Mother. The Throne is rightfully mine, and I will rule from it with justice and fairness. I may even accept you as my advisor and counselor, Delfador"
council_17e="Though you have the Scepter, Princess, it is rightfully Konrad's. You  have it now only because we helped you get it."
council_17f="And if I refuse to give it to him?"
council_17g="If it is necessary, princess, I will ask Konrad to fight you in a duel for it."
council_17h="Delfador! Li'sar has become our friend. I don't want to fight her! As long as she rules well, what does it matter if she becomes queen?"
council_17i="You are the rightful heir. You should be king, Konrad."
council_18="Delfador, you have raised Konrad to be skillful and wise, honorable and just. A warrior who has respect, and appreciates peace. Yet the throne is not the place for him. You know of what I speak, Delfador."
council_19="But I do not! What is your meaning, Parandra?"
council_2="We are indeed honored."
council_20="In time, things will be revealed, fair Princess. For the moment, go forth and claim the throne of Wesnoth."
council_20a="Parandra, what you say may seem right to some, but as long as you and I speak to no-one of what we know, I see no reason why Konrad would not best have the throne."
council_20b="In so many things you are right, Delfador, and your wisdom is unmatched in the world of men. But in this, you are mistaken. Li'sar is the heir. She should take the throne. Now that I have met her for myself, I am sure of it."
council_21="She will claim the throne, and not me? What should I do?"
council_22="Li'sar should be Queen, but you will go with her. Indeed, I suspect we could not convince you otherwise. I have seen the way you look at her, Konrad. I think that now you would follow her even to the ends of the earth."
council_23="With all due respect, my lady, she is my cousin! There is nothing between us!"
council_24="Then if it is as you say, Konrad, perhaps you should stay here with us. It would surely be safer for you. The Elves could show you things that would amaze you, things that no man has seen before."
council_25="That is a generous offer, my lady, but you are indeed right, I would rather go with Li'sar."
council_26="And what say you, Uradredia?"
council_27="Tell me, Li'sar, are you willing to fight your own mother for the throne?"
council_28="It is for the good of the country. If it is necessary, I will fight her, Elf-king."
council_29="I feel that this lady speaks the truth. Delfador, although I know that you do not concur, the words of Parandra, daughter of Elandria are wise. Rest here for a time, and then go forth with them."
council_3="I might also say that it is you who are honored. It has been so long since you have been graced by with the presence of a princess of Wesnoth."
council_30="And you have been with us for a time, Kalenz son of Kliada, what say you?"
council_31="Wisdom has been spoken here today, Delfador. We have been with Li'sar in the most trying of times, and risked life and limb with her. Yet we still have both our lives and our limbs. She lacks experience, and has too much of the brashness of youth, but she will make a good Queen in time."
council_32="So, the Elven Council has spoken. But which path should we take on our journey? The Ford of Abez will not be passible, for surely it will be watched and guarded by many men."
council_33="There is another way by which you can return to Wesnoth: past the mountains of the dragons and through the dark valley. To the land of the East, from there you can return to Wesnoth and surprise the Dark Queen, catching her off-guard."
council_34="Mountains of the dragons? That sounds very dangerous! I didn't even think there were such things as dragons!"
council_35="No dragon has been sighted in those mountains for many years, but they retain their name of old. Still, that path will be dangerous for us. Is there not another route we might take?"
council_36="All routes are dangerous, though there is some hope along this path. Rest, and then go forth, friends. Fortune has smiled upon you so far, despite great dangers. Perhaps she will continue to do so."
council_4="Silence, foolish girl! With such arrogance, is it any surprise that the royal family of Wesnoth long ago saw their ancient alliances fall to pieces?"
council_5="Yes...you are right, sir. It is I who am honored to be here, and I apologize for my discourtesy."
council_6="Delfador the Great. As wise with his tongue in advice as he is strong with his staff in battle. A rare combination, especially among men."
council_7="How quickly do the race of men mature! Only nineteen winters have passed since I last laid eyes on you, Konrad, yet you are now a grown man. A brave warrior stands before me!"
council_8="Forgive me, Elf, but I'm afraid I do not recall meeting you before."
council_9="Konrad, this is Parandra. She helped me rescue you from the clutches of Asheviere."

intro_1="I Garard II's, Wesnoths konges, syvogtyvende år blev kongeriget kastet ind i en bitter strid med det Nordlige folk."
intro_10="Asheviere tog kommandoen over hæren og førte den tilbage til Weldyn. Da hun indså, at kongens unge nevøer var de næste til at efterkomme tronen, beordrede hun dem alle myrdet og erklærede sig selv dronning af Wesnoth"
intro_11="Da Delfador hørte om Ashevieres ordrer, sneg han sig ind på paladset og bortførte Konrad, den yngste af Garards nevøer, for derved at redde ham fra døden"
intro_12="Delfador tog barnet med sig ind i de vestlige skove og opdragede ham under Elvernes beskyttelse, mens han sørgmodigt så til, at Ashevieres forfærdelige kongedømme begyndte at brede sig over landet..."
intro_13="... men én af orkerne overlevede længe nok til at overbringe nyhederne til dronningen."
intro_14="...and she sent her most able commander."
intro_2="Den Nordlige hær havde slået lejr ved Galcadar, ved Fort Abez, og kongen førte sine tropper ud for at møde dem. Han delte sin hær i to og kommanderede selv den ene halvdel, mens hans søn, Kronprins Eldred, kommanderede den anden."
intro_3="Eldred var en modig og frygtløs kriger, der havde gode leder-evner. Uheldigvis for Garard var han også ambitiøs..... og forræderisk. I kampens hede vendte Eldreds mænd sig mod deres konge. Garard blev dræbt i kampen denne dag sammen med hans bror og alle hans sønner bortset fra Eldred"
intro_4="Garard's dronning, Asheviere, så frydefuldt til, da hun var ankommet for at følge kampen fra en nærliggende bakke. Hendes søn måtte da klart regere på en måde, der tilfredsstillede hendes magtsyge, langt bedre end hendes mand havde gjort det."
intro_5="Den Nordlige konge sluttede gladeligt fred med Eldred i bytte for guld. Eldred erklærede sig selv konge og førte sin hær tilbage mod Weldyn."
intro_6="Men Garards ærke-troldmand, Delfador, havde undsluppet kampen og red hastigt til for derved at nå først til Weldyn. Han fik samlet en hær af loyale beboere til at kæmpe mod Eldred og hævne kongens død."
intro_7="Eldred trådte i kamp med hans moders klare råd i sit sind: Kæmp ikke mod nogen hverken store eller små bortset fra den gamle troldmand, hvis hoved skal kløves fra kroppen."
intro_8="Eldred mødte så sandelig Delfador ansigt til ansigt i kamp. Sværdet klingede mod staven. Den erfarne troldmand mod den unge, stærke, hårdføre kriger."
intro_9="Delfadors mænd tabte kampen og resterne måtte flygte, men Asheviere fandt hendes søns krop spiddet til jorden af Delfadors stav."

isledamn_1a="But the voyage did not go as smoothly as had been hoped. A storm blew up and bore down on the ship. Though all hands were on deck working desperately, a sudden gust of wind flung Konrad overboard as he attempted to secure the sails..."
isledamn_2a="The mermen finally saved Konrad from the sea, but were unable to get him back to the ship. With great effort though, they reached a nearby island..."
isledamn_3="Pyh, jeg overlevede. Men hvor er jeg nu? Er denne ø beboet?"
isledamn_4a="We have heard only the worst things about this place, my lord. It is said that the fiends of the undead have come in great numbers and turned the island into an ugly wasteland."
isledamn_5="Lad os håbe at disse rygter ikke taler sandt! Jeg har ingen af mine mænd med mig! Hvordan skal jeg forsvare mig?"

msg10_11="Hvad siger du, Delfador?"
msg10_12="Nej! Vi har ingen tid at spilde, vi må prøve at nå toppen af passet, tage os i agt for bjerg-trolde og holde os væk fra vandet!"
msg10_13="Benknækkerne vil hjælpe jer på jeres rejse, se, fra landsbyerne mod øst rejser de sig, de mægtige benknækkere!!! Til kamp!"

msg10_20 ="Tja, vi har overvundet vores fjender, så lad os håbe, at bjerget ikke får bugt med os!"
msg10_21="Jeg ønsker jer det bedste på jeres rejse, jeg må vende tilbage til min landsby og tage mig af min familie. Dværgenes gæstfrihed vil være på jeres side, hvorend I går, mine venner!"
msg10_22="Lad os komme afsted!"
msg10_3a="Men, jeg kan ikke se så godt med alt den tåge omkring os!"
msg10_4b="Vi må være på vagt... det siges, at der bor en troldmand i disse bjerge, og han er bestemt ikke gæstfri. Det er ham, der forårsager tågerne, der vildleder gennemrejsende, som derefter fortæres af hans skabninger."
msg10_5b="Hans.... skabninger? Vi må holde os til vejen, mænd!"
msg10_6b="Han siges at være en mægtig modstander, Konrad. Det siges, at da dværgene byggede denne vej, forstyrrede de en ældgammel troldmands hvileplads, og siden den dag har han og hans bror rejst rundt på bjerget og skabt kaos i de dværgiske landsbyer."
msg10_7b="Lad os da gå forsigtigt men hurtigt, mænd!"
msg10_9="Vær hilset rejsende, jeg er Stalrag, sherif for disse landsbyer! Jeg må advare jer, en mægtig troldmand og hans trolde befinder sig i bjergene og vil ganske sikkert angribe. Jeg vil tilkalde mine stammefolk til at hjælpe dig!"
msg10a_20="Aaargh! Jeg er færdig! Kæmp videre uden mig, mine brødre!"
msg11_1="Dørene er lukkede og barrikaderede indefra!"
msg11_10="Legenden var sand! Der er altid tentakel-skabninger skjult i søerne nær de Dværgiske Riger"
msg11_11="Endelig, dette er indgangen til det dværgiske rige."
msg11_12="Det eneste, jeg kan se, er ruiner og fattige landsbyer."
msg11_13="De fattige landsbyboer, der boede her og handlede med dværgene, bliver nu holdt som orkernes slaver."
msg11_14="Som de onde orkers slaver? Vi må befri dem!"
msg11_15="Det ville ikke være et klogt valg, vores mission er at finde Ildscepteret. Hvis vi forsinker vores rejse her, så vil de orkiske horder omringe os."
msg11_16="Konrad, mærk dig Delfadors ord, vi vender tilbage hertil senere, og så vil orkernes tag på landet blive løftet."
msg11_17="Jeg er ikke tryg ved dette, men jeg kan godt se, at vi bliver nødt til at skynde os."
msg11_17a="My uncle used to smuggle...err...I mean...trade food for the Dwarves. He could get grain carts in under the very noses of those ugly orcs."
msg11_17b="He must be hiding in one of those villages."
msg11_17c="Haw! My niece's friends are mine friends too"
msg11_2b="Vi kan ikke komme ind! Hvad skal vi nu gøre?"
msg11_3="Det siges, at orkerne brugte en gammel minetunnel for at overraske dværgene. Det må være den der mod nordøst."
msg11_4="Jamen, så må vi jo nå hen til minetunnelen!"
msg11_5a="Der er ikke tid til forsinkelser eller ligegyldigt sludder, fremad!"
msg11_5b="Jeg tøver med at gå derind. Det bliver så svært i mørket!"
msg11_5c="Vi må sandelig ikke lade vente på os. Jeg kommer i tanke om, at minerne mod nordøst er den bedste vej derind!"
msg11_5d="Men Konrad's mænd var ikke ene om at træde ind i disse miner..."
msg11_6="Dværgenes forsvar skulle have været stærkt. Se disse ødelagte tårne!"
msg11_7="Kampen udenfor var hård og varede et halvt år, men kampene inde i tunnelerne var værre."
msg11_9="Der er et monster, der skjuler sig i denne sø!"
msg11_9a="Ruarrrrr!!!"
msg12_1="Der er så mørkt herinde! Jeg kan næsten ikke se noget!"
msg12_10="Nu går du for vidt! Jeg er Kalenz, en mægtig Elvisk herre! Hvor vover sådan en som du, der lusker rundt i hans tunnel, at kalde mig en kujon?"
msg12_11="Fred, venner! Fred! De onde Orker raser på landene over os, skal vi nu også slås blandt vore egne?"
msg12_12="Godt så! Hvem er du? Forklar da din tilstedeværelse her, menneske. Hvorfor har du risikeret liv og lemmer for at komme til Knalga, Dværgenes hjem?"
msg12_13="Tja, altså, vi....vi..."
msg12_14="Vi er kommet, for at en tronfølger kan gøre krav på sin arv. For at en konge kan gøre krav på sin trone. Vi søger Ildscepteret."
msg12_15="Ildscepteret? Er I blevet gale? Sandelig må I da tale i spøg!"
msg12_16="Vi spøger ikke, min ven. Vi søger Ildscepteret. Vi søger hjælp fra Dværgene til at finde det. I kan vælge ikke at hjælpe os, hvis det er, hvad I ønsker. Vi vil finde det med eller uden jeres hjælp."
msg12_17="Du taler som et fjols. Der er ikke engang nogen, der ved, om Ildscepteret overhovedet eksisterer. Hvem er denne arving, denne konge om hvem du taler, da?"
msg12_18="Det er mig, Sir."
msg12_19="Dig, haha, denne dreng, der står foran mig, skulle være kongen af Wesnoth? Haha! Jeg har ikke moret mig så meget i lang tid. Og hvem er du så, gamle mand?"
msg12_2="Ja, det er så sandelig mørkt. Vi må tænde nogle fakler og træde langsomt og varsomt. Forhåbentlig er der stadig nogle Dværge hernede, som kan hjælpe os!"
msg12_20="Jeg er Delfador. Delfador den Store, King Garards Ærke-Troldmand og hans arvings Protektor."
msg12_21="Du....du er Delfador? Jeg har set Delfador, da jeg kun var en ung Dværg, og jeg siger dig dette, gamle mand, du er ikke Delfador. Mænd! Fjern disse løgnere fra mit åsyn. Delfador døde for mange år siden."
msg12_22="Jeg er Delfador den Store! Enhver, der vover at stå imod mig, skal nedkæmpes!"
msg12_23="Du...du er virkelig Delfador! Men vi havde fået at vide, at du var død for mange år siden!"
msg12_24="De troede, jeg var død. De håbede, jeg var død. Men alligevel, alligevel overlevede jeg."
msg12_25="Og I tror virkelig, at I kan finde Ildscepteret?"
msg12_26="Ja, det gør vi. Hvis du hjælper os, min ven, vil alle Knalgas skatte, vi måtte finde, være dine. Vi ønsker kun Scepteret. Det vil være farligt. Tag endelig ikke fejl af dette: Nogle Dværge vil blive slået ihjel, måske endda mange Dværge. Men det er da sandelig bedre end at gemme sig for Orkerne som en flok orm."
msg12_29="Hmm... der ser ud til at være en hemmelig indgang bag disse sten!"
msg12_3="Ganske vist. Vi Elvere er ikke så godt trænede til sådan nogle mørke huler."
msg12_30="Der er store rigdomme i denne skattekiste! Jeg tæller to hundrede stykker guld!"
msg12_5="Hvem er disse, der er ankommet? Overflade-beboere! Til våben, mænd!"
msg12_6="Vi kommer med fred, venner. Vi kommer med fred!"
msg12_7="Nå, det gør I? Jeg kan se, at du endda er akkompanieret af Elvere. Kan vi Dværge ikke leve i fred uden, at de bedrageriske Elvere kommer for at forstyrre os?"
msg12_8="Hvorfor så fjendtligt-sindede ord, Dværg? Elvere har aldrig gjort jer nogen skade."
msg12_9="Aldrig gjort os nogen skade? Hvorfor så jeg så selv, da Elverne ikke kom for at ære vores alliance? Mange Dværge blev nedslagtet, og I kujonagtige Elvere gjorde ingenting for at hjælpe!"
msg13_1="Disse er nogle af de dværgiske hoved-huler."
msg13_10="Jorden ryster."
msg13_2="Undergrundsveje førte til de forskellige dele af komplekset, men nu ligger alt i ruiner."
msg13_3="Skiltet siger 'Gæstekvarterer'"
msg13_4="Min onkels familie druknede, da orkerne oversvømmede denne hule..."
msg13_5="Disse passager ser ud til at have været i brug på det seneste."
msg13_6="Der er en stor hule-sammenstyrtning mod syd."
msg13_7="RUMLE! RYSTE! BULDRE!"
msg13_8="Stenene bevæger sig!"
msg13_9a="Hvem der? Ven eller fjende?"
msg13_9b="Vi prøver desperat på at rydde disse tunneler for de fæle Orker! Hjælp os venligst med denne opgave."
msg13_9c="Ah, en fæl Ork! Lad os rydde disse tunneler for dens slags!"
msg13_9d="Jeg vidste ikke, at de levende døde var i disse huler!"
msg13_9e="Hvem er denne fæle fjende, vi kæmper imod?"
msg13_9f="Jeg er Lionel. Jeg er den Fortabte General. Jeg vil hævne mig på jer alle!"
msg13_9g="Hævne? Hvad har vi gjort mod dig, som fortjener at hævnes?"
msg13_9h="Lionel? En General? Jeg mener at kunne huske det navn..."
msg13_9i="Så du kan huske mig? Mm. Jeg var kongens fineste general, som blev sendt ned i disse huler for at genfinde Scepteret. Men Orkerne tog mig og mine mænd til fange i denne hule og lod os sulte ihjel. Dværgene var ikke til nogen hjælp, de lod mig bare dø. Nu vil jeg få min hævn over jer alle!"
msg13_die1="Argh! Jeg er besejret! Men i det mindste mod værdige modstandere i stedet for disse fæle Orker."
msg13_die2="Hvil i fred, Lionel. Den stakkels, fortabte general."
msg1_1="Fjorten år efter begyndelsen på Ashevieres rige vendte hun opmærksomheden på Elverne, som hun havde stor foragt overfor. Orkiske lejemordere blev hyret og sendt ud for at sikre Elvernes endeligt."
msg1_10="Lad dem bare komme. Vi vil kæmpe mod dem til det sidste!"
msg1_11="Vær forsigtig Konrad! Bevogt ham godt, Delfador!"
msg1_12="Og således begynder det"
msg1_13="Okay, vi har klaret det såvidt! Men hvor tager vi hen nu?"
msg1_14="Vi må rejse mod nord og prøve at klare den helt til Anduin-Øen. Forhåbentlig vil vi kunne søge tilflugt der."
msg1_15="Ja, det er rigtigt, Delfador. Men hvad skal der blive af Elverne her?"
msg1_16="Elverne vil slås. De vil muligvis endda klare den. Men jeg frygter, at det ikke ser godt ud for dem. Lad os ikke tale om dette nu. Afsted!"
msg1_17="Held og lykke Konrad! Du skal ikke bekymre dig om os, vi kæmper så godt, som vi kan!"
msg1_18="Jeg.... Jeg tror ikke, jeg kan klare den længere"
msg1_19="Prins... du må kæmpe videre! Neeeeeej!"
msg1_2="Mester Delfador! Se, der kommer Orker fra alle retninger! Hvad skal vi gøre?"
msg1_20="Det er slut, jeg er dødsdømt...."
msg1_21="Jeg har.... har fejlet i min pligt om at beskytte prinsen, jeg er overvundet"
msg1_22="Du må ikke dø! Delfador! Kom nu, du er nødt til at leve!"
msg1_23="Ugh"
msg1_24="h nej! Vi er løbet tør for tid, de er ankommet med forstærkninger..."
msg1_25="Dø, slyngel, dø!"
msg1_26="Kun et fjols står mod mig i kamp!"
msg1_27="Jeg er Galdrad. Hvis du vil videre, må du kæmpe med mig først!"
msg1_28="Du kommer ikke videre!"
msg1_28a="Jeg er Delfador den Store, forbered jer på at dø!"
msg1_29="Lad mig trampe dig ned, din usling!"
msg1_3="Der er for mange at kæmpe imod. Alt for mange. Vi er nødt til at stikke af!"
msg1_30="De ødelægger vores hjem!"
msg1_31="Der er ingen tid til at se tilbage. Vi må hurtigt tage afsted!"
msg1_4="Men hvortil? Dette er vores eneste hjem! Hvad med Elverne?"
msg1_5="Vi skal nok kæmpe mod fjenden, men du må slippe væk, Konrad. Det vigtigste er, at du slipper væk!"
msg1_6="Vi vil rejse mod nord. Måske kan vi nå Anduin-Øen. Hvis vi kan nå helt dertil, så må vi da være i sikkerhed. Konrad, vi skal rekruttére nogle Elvere til at hjælpe os, og så må du nå frem til skiltet mod nord-vest. Jeg beskytter dig!"
msg1_7="Fint nok, lad os skynde os!"
msg1_8="Angrib Elverne, mænd, tag deres landsbyer, lad os indtage dette land i dronningens navn!"
msg1_9="Haha! Vi flår de beskidte Elvere i småstykker!"
msg1_9hard="Remember, it is rumored that the filthy mage and one that he protects are in these parts. They are the ones we want!"
msg1b_12="Vi må rejse videre nu."
msg1b_13="Jeg har fejlet overfor Blackwater havne-folkene...."
msg1b_14="Uden hans hjælp er vi ude af stand til at bruge skibene, der er intet håb..."
msg1b_1a="We should be able to board a ship at Blackwater Port, but it seems the Orcs are heading there too. Rebels who hate Asheviere and are loyal to the memory of the king desperately hold the port, as it is one of the only places where they can ship supplies and weapons."
msg1b_2="Delfador, nogle Orker følger vores spor! Vi må skynde os!"
Vi hørte nyhederne om, at orkerne angreb de elviske skove, og at nogle af dem også tog herpå for at angribe os, men vores forsvar er stadig svagt."
msg1b_3a="Delfador, my old friend! We had heard of your coming, and of the attacks on the Elves. It is good to see you again, although I would prefer it were not in such sad times."
msg1b_3b="Konrad, this is Kaylan, one of the mightiest of the horse lords, and one of the few who is willing to oppose the dark crown. Rumor has it that his lance has slain fifty men and a hundred orcs."
msg1b_3c="It seems the orcs have come here too, to try to wrest this port from our hands. Our defenses are still weak, but reinforcements will arrive soon!"
msg1b_4="Vi vil hjælpe jer med at jage dem væk."
msg1b_5c="Hopefully with your help we can ward them off. But you must not tarry here long, for your survival is even more important to our cause than the strength of the port. A ship is due here in two days, surely it will be able to take you to safety."
msg1b_5d="And the ship will take us to Anduin?"
msg1b_5e="Yes, we will sail to the Isle of Anduin, my home Konrad, and the home of many mages."
msg1b_5f="I will send one of my horsemen to serveunder you. I offer you my support Konrad, and the support of my men - from now on you will be able to recruit horsemen."
msg1b_5g_a="Thank you, sir. But how shall I best use these horsemen? How do they differ from Elves?"
msg1b_5h="Elves are a powerful race, Konrad, more powerful than my own people usually acknowledge. But horsemen are powerful in a different way. They have no long range attack, but can charge into combat, inflicting double normal damage, though taking double damage in return. They are also lawful, meaning they are better at day, and worse at night. Horsemen are unmatched on open land, though Elves will serve you better in rugged terrain."
msg1b_5i="Recruit troops wisely, Konrad, and remember that you can recall experienced units from past battles to help you fight again."
msg1b_6a="Reinforcements have arrived! Forward men! I expect each of you to bring me back the head of an orc!"
msg1b_7a="So many foul humans riding on horses! There is no way we can defeat them. Quick, we must make our escape!"
msg1b_8a="Thank you for the help, friends. The ship should arrive soon, it will take you to Anduin."
msg2_1="Og det skete at vores lille gruppe nåede Anduin-Øen..."
msg2_2="Så dette er Anduin. Det ser lidt... øde ud"
msg2_3a="I fear so, Konrad. It seems that the Orcs have come even here. Here to the place where I was born, where I was trained."
msg2_4="Hvem har vi her? Ah, en gruppe elvere er ankommet, vi vil tvinge dem tilbage til havet!"
msg2_5="Jeg havde ikke troet, at Orkerne ville komme helt hertil. Denne ø plejede at være så smuk. Vi er nødt til at genindtage den! Til angreb!"
msg2_6a="Delfador, my old master! You have saved the island from the Orcs!"
msg2_6b="My apprentice. How did the island fall to such as these?"
msg2_6c="You have not heard, master Delfador? Asheviere is trying to control the entire western coast. She hired many Orcs and sent them here. The Orcs were holding me here until a ship arrived to take me to Weldyn to stand trial for treason for training mages!"
msg2_6d="We have come from fighting her forces at Blackwater. Where else has she attacked?"
msg2_6e="She has taken control of the Bay of Pearls, long held by the mermen, and has enslaved the mermen, making them dive for pearls for her. With the pearls she grows richer every day. There are even rumors that she may break the ancient treaty and attack Elensefar!"
msg2_6f="Can't we strike back at her? How many forces does she have at the Bay of Pearls? Can we take it back from her?"
msg2_6g="Go there, we must. Let us rest here a little, and then we shall set sail for the Bay. Hopefully we will be able to defeat her forces there!"
msg2_mage_1="I found someone hiding in the village!"
msg2_mage_2="My lords, I have been hiding in the village from the orcs, like many of the other mages here. Perhaps we can work together to recapture the island!"
msg2_mage_3="Certainly, let us join together to fight the evil ones"
msg2_mage_4="You can now recruit mages"
msg3_1="Så dette er Perlebugten. Det ser ud til, at de har sat havmændene i hårdt arbejde!"
msg3_10="Men... men... hvordan kan det ske for mig?"
msg3_11="Hvem var den idiot?"
msg3_12="Endelig fri! Nu bringer vi død over Orkerne!"
msg3_13="Nu hvor vi er frie, vil vi sammen nedkæmpe vores undertrykkere!"
msg3_13a="Død over orkerne! Kom, lad os nedkæmpe dem, mænd!"
msg3_14="Frihed! Hvor er de Orker nu? Lad mig få fat på dem!"
msg3_15="Tak fordi du reddede os! Nu kan vi hjælpe dig i kampen mod de onde Orker!"
msg3_16="Endelig, vi har befriet havmændene. Tag tilbage til havet og forlad os i fred."
msg3_17="Herre! Du har nok i fremtiden brug for nogle af vores skabning, da du kan bruge vores gode evner på havet. Vi tilbyder dig vores hjælp og tager med dig."
msg3_18="Hvor er Delfador nu? Jeg håber, han er OK!"
msg3_19="Så sandelig jeg er, min ven."
msg3_2="Ja, det gør det ganske vist. Det ser også ud til, at de har mange, mange tropper. Jeg tror, jeg tager omkring bugten og leder noget af deres opmærksomhed væk. Du og resten af vores mænd vil redde havmændene!"
msg3_20="Der er du! Jeg er så glad for, at du har klaret den! Nu har vi tid til at hvile lidt."
msg3_21="Jeg er bange for, at der ikke er tid til at hvile. Konrad, Asheviere angriber lige nu Elensefar og bryder den århundrede-gamle traktat mellem Wesnoth og Elense by-staten. Hvis byen falder, er det forfærdeligt at tænke på, hvor mange andre lande, hun kan opsluge!"
msg3_22="h nej! Hvad kan vi gøre?"
msg3_23="Du må føre vores mænd frem til byen og prøve at hjælpe med at forsvare den - eller generobre den, hvis den falder, før du ankommer."
msg3_24="Skal JEG gøre det? Men hvad med dig, Delfador? Du følger da med mig, ikke?"
msg3_25="Desværre ikke, Konrad. Jeg er faldet over nogle vigtige dokumenter, og jeg må hurtigt få dem bragt til det Elviske Råd. Det ser ud til, at vi har mindre tid til at stoppe Asheviere, end jeg havde troet."
msg3_26="Men Delfador! Jeg kan ikke klare det på egen hånd!"
msg3_27="På egen hånd? Herre! Vi, dine loyale soldater, vil støtte dig!"
msg3_28="Du skal nok klare det. Jeg tror på dig. Rejs mod nord. Elensefar er kun tre dages rejse herfra, hvis du skynder dig."
msg3_29a="Udmærket. Men hvordan kommer jeg til Elensefar?"
msg3_3="Fint nok. Vær forsigtig!"
msg3_30_farewell="Jeg ønsker dig en sikker rejse, Konrad. Indtil vi ses igen!"
msg3_30_farewella="Hav en sikker rejse, Konrad. Må solen skinne på jer."
msg3_30_optiona="Ships? Ugh! I have been sea sick for the last time. We shall walk!"
msg3_30_optionb="Going by ship we may at least get a little rest for ourselves. By sea it is!"
msg3_30a="Det er mod nordvest, blot nogle kilometer fra kysten. Der er to måder at komme derhen på, med skib eller over landjorden. Hver vej har sine egne farer og fælder. Du må selv vælge, hvordan du ønsker at komme derhen."
msg3_31="Har du ikke kunnet overvinde vores fjender igennem alle disse dage? De har tilkaldt forstærkninger. Nu må vi da sandelig være dødsdømte!"
msg3_32="Konrad! Vi kan ikke spilde mere tid her. Selvom det dog ville være godt at besejre Orkerne og befri alle dem, vi kan, så er der vigtigere sager, der kalder!"
msg3_33="Delfador, gudskelov at du har overlevet! Det har været en hård kamp, men hvorfor kan vi ikke færdiggøre den? Hvorfor skal vi tage afsted igen?"
msg3_34="Jeg har dårlige nyheder: Asheviere har angrebet Elensefar og brudt traktaten mellem Wesnoth og Elensefar. Du skal føre vores mænd til byen for at hjælpe med at forsvare den -- eller generobre den, hvis den falder i fjendens hænder, før du når frem."
msg3_35="Og det skal jeg gøre? Men du følger da med mig, gør du ikke, Delfador?"
msg3_36="Det er jeg bange for, at jeg ikke gør, Konrad. Jeg har fundet nogle vigtige dokumenter, der skal ses på. Jeg må ride afsted omgående for at holde råd med Elverne. Vi vil mødes i Elensefar, efter du har sikret byen."
msg3_37="Jeg frygter, jeg vil komme til at kæmpe hårdt for at kunne klare dette selv, men det, der skal ske, skal ske. Hvordan kommer jeg til Elensefar?"
msg3_38="Eftersom du har brudt Orkernes herredømme over havene, ville det være sikrest at rejse med et skib. Sejl langs kysten og du vil kunne lægge til land kun nogle kilometer fra Elensefar. Fart på!"
msg3_39="Så længe Orkerne har herredømmet over havene, ville det ikke være sikkert at rejse med skib. Rejs på landjorden, Elensefar er kun seks dages vandring op ad kysten. Fart på!"
msg3_4="Men chef, hvorfor bruger vi kun flagermus og nagaer?"
msg3_5="Fordi vi er nødt til at have kontrol over havene og havfolket, og nagaer og flagermus er bedst til at klare dette!"
msg3_6="Men orker er den stærkeste race i hele..."
msg3_7="Klap i, orm! Jeg er chefen!"
msg3_8="Hahaha! Nu vil orkerne regere over både land og vand!"
msg3_9="(Suk) er der nogen, der vil myrde den idiot for mig?"
msg4_1="Men vejen til Elensefar var forræderisk. Konrad og hans mænd blev angrebet af de levende dødes soldater."
msg4_10_a="Surprise! Searching for Mages, and all I get is these foul humans!"
msg4_11="Dette tempel ser ud til at være tomt."
msg4_12b="Sejren er vores! Lad os bare håbe, at denne forsinkelse ikke vil stoppe vores forsøg på at redde Elensefar. Vi må fremad hurtigt!"
msg4_2="Herre! Der er noget, der bevæger sig i de gamle ruiner!"
msg4_3="Det ser ud til, at der er levende døde der! Forbered jer på kamp, mænd!"
msg4_4="Til angreb!"
msg4_5="Ahh, en gruppe Elvere ankommer. Snart har vi Elviske zombier iblandt os!"
msg4_6_a="There are some ancient temples to the south-west, I wonder what might be inside them!"
msg4_7="Det ser ud som om, at nogen skjuler sig i templet."
msg4_8="Jeg gemte mig på dette hellige sted, mens jeg planlagde, hvordan jeg skulle nedkæmpe de onde levende døde, og nu kan vi sammen tilintetgøre dem."
msg4_9="Det ser ud som om, at nogen skjuler sig i templet."
msg4_moredie="Kæmp videre mod de levende døde uden mig, venner!"
msg5_1="Gruppen ankom endelig ved Elensefar men måtte sande, at byen allerede var faldet til de onde Orker."
msg5_10="Tyve, hmmm? Hvem siger, vi kan stole på jeres slags?"
msg5_11="Vi kan selvfølgelig forstå det, hvis I ikke stoler på os, men det er i vores begges interesse at drive Orkerne ud af byen!"
msg5_12a="Hmm...Jeg vil overveje dette..."
msg5_13a="We will serve you well, for we respect the help you are providing to our city. You shall find that there is honor, even among thieves."
msg5_14a="Very well, we shall be gone then. You shall have to recapture the city without our help!"
msg5_14b="Finally, we have retaken the city! Let us rest here, friends."
msg5_14c="Victory! The thieves of Elensefar will be in your service, my lord"
msg5_15b="The party rested for three days, after which an old friend returned."
msg5_16="Vær hilset, mine venner. Jeg ser, at I har reddet byen! Jeg vidste, I kunne klare det."
msg5_17="Delfador! Godt at se dig! Hvor har du været?"
msg5_18="Jeg har haft et møde med det Store Elverråd. Dette er Kalenz, en herre fra de Nordlige Elvere, som kom til Rådet for at tilbyde os de Nordlige Elveres støtte"
msg5_19="Vær hilset, ven."
msg5_2="Herre! Det ser ud til, at byen allerede er faldet til de overlegne magter!"
msg5_20="Delfador, vi har indtaget denne by, men Ashevieres mænd vil da med sikkerhed komme og angribe os! Hvad skal vi gøre?"
msg5_21="Rådet har mødtes, og vi har besluttet: Vi må finde Ildscepteret"
msg5_22="Ildscepteret? Hvad er det?"
msg5_23="Under Garard I's regeringstid, din onkels far, accepterede dværgene fra Knalga at lave kongen et fantastisk scepter. Det tog deres fineste smede år at lave det. Men kort efter det blev færdiggjort, invaderede Orker Knalgas tunneler. Nu er Knalga i kaos, og selvom nogle dværge stadig lever i nogle af dets egne, konstant i krig med Orkerne, er sceptret gået tabt et sted inde i de gigantiske huler."
msg5_24="Aha, men hvad har det med mig at gøre?"
msg5_25="Garard II, din onkel, var ved at overveje en efterfølger. Han lavede en ed om, at det royale familie-medlem, der kunne få Ildscepteret tilbage, skulle regere landet."
msg5_26="Aha, og du vil have mig til at finde dette scepter?"
msg5_26a="Vi vil hjælpe dig med at få fat i det, herre."
msg5_27="Vi har ikke meget tid. Vi tror også, at Asheviere leder efter sceptret for at hjælpe med at holde på hendes plads som hersker. Men dog, hvis du finder sceptret først, så vil folket støtte dig som deres konge."
msg5_28="Mig? Deres konge?"
msg5_29="Ja, Konrad. Jeg tror på, at du bliver konge en dag. Men nu må vi skynde os afsted!"
msg5_3="Dette er forfærdelige nyheder! Vi må genindtage byen!"
msg5_4="Der er så mange af dem. Det her bliver ikke nemt! Og se mod syd, det ser ud til, at de levende døde er allierede med Orkerne!"
msg5_5="Der kommer Elverne! Med vores nyligt formede alliance med Orkerne vil vi nemt knuse dem!"
msg5_6="Vi må indtage byen og tilintetgøre de onde levende døde, før deres forstærkninger ankommer!"
msg5_7="Midt om natten kryber tre mørke figurer ud af skoven"
msg5_8="Holdt! Hvem er der? Ven eller fjende?"
msg5_9="Vær hilset, ven. Vi kommer fra Elensefars Tyve-Forening. Vi vil hjælpe jer mod Orkerne!"
msg6_1="På vej mod Knalga blev vores helte mødt af Ashevieres soldater"
msg6_2="Dronningen har beordret mig til at stoppe dig, din bedrager!"
msg6_27="Jeg overgiver mig! Du må ikke gøre mig noget, din bedrager."
msg6_28="Jeg sagde før, at jeg IKKE var en bedrager, men hvis du overgiver dig, så vil jeg lade dig leve."
msg6_29="Lad mig gå!"
msg6_3="Det er prinsessen, Li'sar. Dronningen adopterede hende, og det rygtes, at hun opdrager hende til at være hendes efterkommer!"
msg6_30="Tænk på historien om den gamle konge, spørg en gammel person om den."
msg6_31="Den gamle konge? Jeg har hørt om ham, men jeg ved, at det ikke er sandt. Det har min moder fortalt mig."
msg6_32="Din moder har løjet for dig, mit barn. Nu foreslår jeg, at du tænker lidt over det og enten slutter dig til os eller flygter i eksil. Der vil snart være en stor krig, og hvis du er på den forkerte side af denne, så får vi nok ikke muligheden for at skåne dit liv en anden gang."
msg6_33="Jeg er ikke et barn, og jeg vil ikke tale om det! I sagde, I ville skåne mit liv, så se at komme videre. Den nordlige vej skulle være sikker for jer."
msg6_34="Fortsat god dag, prinsesse. Følg mig, mænd, ad den nordlige vej!"
msg6_35="(hæhæ, de ved intet om, hvor mange levende døde der har gået ad den nordlige vej på det seneste. De er i sandhed dødsdømte!)"
msg6_4="Jeg er ikke en bedrager, det ser ud til, at din moder har løjet for dig om dette."
msg6_4b="Forræderi! Dine løgne vil gå i døden sammen med dig!"
msg6_5="Det nytter ikke noget at prøve at bringe hende til fornuft. Der er kun én ting, hun vil forstå. Til angreb!"
msg6_6="Det her tager for lang tid, jeg må hellere kalde på forstærkning!"
msg6_7="Måske brugte jeg ikke nok tropper..."
msg7_1="Herre! Denne vej ser ikke så sikker ud, som vi havde håbet på. Se omkring os på bakkerne, der er levende døde i området!"
msg7_10a="Solen står op i øst. De levende døde kan da ikke have kraften til at fortsætte deres nedslagtning i endnu en dag!"
msg7_10b="Bestemt ikke! Jeg fornemmer, at vi har overlevet denne kamp."
msg7_10c="Pyha! Det var en hård kamp, men endelig er de på flugt!"
msg7_11="Ja! Vi har tvunget dem væk"
msg7_12a="Dette sted giver mig myrekryb, selvom de levende døde er på flugt. Hvor kan vi gå hen nu?"
msg7_12b="Tak fordi du vendte tilbage for at hjælpe os, Moremirmu."
msg7_12c_a="It greatly saddens me that Moremirmu was slain on the field, after he helped us."
msg7_13a="Landet Wesnoth er ikke sikkert for os. Dronningens magt når hvert eneste hjørne. Vi må skynde os til de nordlige lande på den anden side af den store flod. Lad os komme afsted hurtigt!"
msg7_13b="Det er både min pligt og fornøjelse, min herre! Vi nød et måltid med nogle af prinsessens royale vagter og holdt et hvil fra vores lange rejse, alt imens de talte om, hvordan du blev narret til at rejse gennem disse farlige lande. Vi kunne ikke gøre andet end at hjælpe jer!"
msg7_13c="Må han hvile fredfyldt!"
msg7_14a="Så sandelig! Lad os tage væk herfra!"
msg7_14b="Aha, hun narrede os med vilje til at tage denne vej! Hvor kan vi tage hen nu? Hvilken vej vil være sikker for os?"
msg7_14c="Han døde, mens han kæmpede for dig, prins, præcis som enhver af os ville være rede til at dø for dig."
msg7_15b="Du må slippe væk fra den onde dronnings greb, min herre. Hvis du sætter kursen mod nordøst forbi griffernes bjerg, vil du kunne klare dig over den store flod ved Abez. Men du må dog skynde dig, for du vil ikke kunne komme over floden, når vinteren kommer!"
msg7_16b="Tak for dit råd, gode ven! Må vores veje mødes igen i gladere stunder!"
msg7_2="Hvem er disse, der nærmer sig? Lad os dræbe dem alle!"
msg7_3="Til angreb, mænd! De levende døde er på vej mod os!"
msg7_3_a="Let us never surrender to these foul beasts of the pit! We fight until victory, or until every one of us is slain!"
msg7_4="Der er virkelig mange! Hvad i himlens navn skal vi gøre?"
msg7_5="Vi må bare holde dem tilbage så lang tid, som vi kan!"
msg7_6b="Jeg er endnu engang kommet for at hjælpe jer, venner!"
msg7_7b="Hvide troldmænd? Kommet for at hjælpe os? Men hvad laver de her?"
msg7_8b_a="That is Moremirmu! He helped us fight the undead in the Isles of the Damned, let us hope he can help us once more!"
msg8_1a="Hvad er dette for et sted? Det er et højt bjerg!"
msg8_2b="Det er det sagnomspundne Grifbjerg! Vi skal være forsigtige her, det kunne vise sig at være farligt at forstyrre grifferne."
msg8_3c="Gryphon Mountain! Maybe we could steal some eggs from the gryphons and train the young to be flying mounts. Would that work, Delfador?"
msg8_4b="Vi kan da prøve at gøre det, selvom det så sandelig kan være farligt! Men måske kunne brugen af griffer være os til stor hjælp senere. Vi er under alle omstændigheder nødsaget til at rejse herigennem."
msg8_5b="Jamen lad os start med at klatre op af det bjerg!"
msg8_5c="Det ser ud til, at vi ikke er de eneste, der er interesserede i dette bjerg. Endnu engang står Dronningen i vejen for os!"
msg8_5d="Hurtigt, mænd! Fremad!"
msg8_6="Vi har overvundet dem! Hvad gør vi nu?"
msg8_7="Vi må fortsætte mod nord. Det er for sent at vende tilbage til Elensefars eller Anduins sikkerhed, før vinteren falder omkring os. Så derfor må vi krydse den store flod og fortsætte mod Dværgenes land. Kom, lad os gå!"
msg8_8="Med disse grif-æg skulle vi være i stand til at yngle griffer, der kan adlyde os. Dette vil lade os hyre grif-riddere!"
msg8_8b="It is a shame we could not get those Gryphon eggs - they would surely have given us an advantage sometime. Still, we must continue."
msg8_9b="Lad os fortsætte fremad!"
msg9_1="Dette er Fort Abez. Det er her, din fader og onkel blev forrådt og dræbt. Det er næsten nitten år siden nu, Konrad."
msg9_10="Det fjols slog sig selv ihjel."
msg9_11="Hvad mener du, Delfador?"
msg9_12="Jeg samlede mænd til at kæmpe mod forræder-kongen og selvfølgelig Asheviere, der stod bag det hele. Vi var i undertal, muligvis fire til én. I kampens hede kom den dumme dreng løbende mod mig og slog vildt omkring sig. Jeg havde intet andet valg end at gøre det af med ham."
msg9_13b="Så det er sandt, at du dræbte ham?"
msg9_14b="Han døde sandeligt i kampen, for min hånd. Det er trist, at dine brødre ikke havde muligheden for at opleve en sådan 'værdig' død, Konrad."
msg9_16="Med al respekt til mine herrer, vi må skynde os. Vi er nødt til at krydse floden nu. Se! Det ser ud til, at vagttårnene på flodbredden er bevogtede!"
msg9_17="Hvem er disse, der prøver at krydse floden? Vi er nødt til at stoppe dem, mænd!"
msg9_18="Er der ikke et andet sted, vi kan krydse floden? Måske længere oppe ad floden?"
msg9_19="Vinteren vil hurtigt være over os. Vi har kun få dage til at krydse floden, og den nærmeste bro er langt oppe ad floden. Det ville være det rene selvmord at være strandet syd for floden, når vinteren kommer. Asheviere ville slå os ihjel som rotter! Vi må krydse her."
msg9_19b="Der er de! Så er det sandt, de har stoppet de levende døde. Nu prøver de at forlade Wesnoth. Vi må ikke lade dem krydse floden. Efter dem, mænd!"
msg9_2="Er det rigtigt? Hvad skete der egentlig, Delfador?"
msg9_20a="Ikke hende igen! Hurtigt, vi må skynde os!"
msg9_3="Kongens hær havde slået lejr her. Den nordlige hær havde slået lejr på den nordlige side af floden. I tre dage and tre nætter stod hærene overfor hinanden, og ingen af dem var villige til at krydse floden. På den fjerde dag krydsede de nordlige hære floden og angreb os."
msg9_4b="Og så.... blev vi besejret?"
msg9_5="Vi så ud til at vinde kampen. Vi holdt dem tilbage."
msg9_6="Lige indtil kongens søn, midt i kampens hede, lige indtil han vendte sig mod kongen!"
msg9_7b="Men du hævnede mordet. Du slog prinsen ihjel, ikke, Delfador?"
msg9_8="Da jeg så kongen forrådt og så hans banner falde, flygtede jeg fra kampen. Hvadenten det var visdom eller fejhed flygtede jeg fra kampen, da jeg kunne se, at der ikke var håb for os den dag."
msg9_9b="Åh, men Elverne har altid fortalt mig, at du slog prinsen ihjel, Delfador, selvom du aldrig talte om det."
msg9_a1="Ruaarrrrrrrr!"
msg9_a2="Hvad var det?"
msg9_a3="Dybets skabninger er over os! Dette kan være meget farligt. Hurtigt, vi må se at komme over på den anden side så hurtigt, vi kan!"
msg9_a4="Vi er nået sikkert over floden! Hvor går turen hen nu?"
msg9_a5="Vi må fortsætte mod nord. Vi må prøve at få hjælp fra de nordlige Dværge, hvis vi skal have et håb om at bryde ind i Knalga."
msg9_a6="Jeg kan ikke tro det, de er nået væk! Vi må skynde os efter dem. Efter dem, mænd, lad os også krydse floden! Vi vil mødes igen, fæle bedrager."
msg9_a7="Tror du virkelig, hun vil følge efter os, Delfador?"
msg9_a8="Det ser sandelig ud til, at hun vil forsøge, men havets skabninger vil gøre det svært for hende. Vi må fortsætte fremad. Hvis hun når hele vejen over inden vinter så lad det være så!"
msg_delfador_die="Nej! Her slutter det hele! Vi er blevet overvundet!"
msg_doors_lisar="Pyha! Vi klarer os gennem bjergenes farlige tåge, og nu er der dette kaos foran os! Kom, mænd! Vi må nå ind i minerne, for de er stadig foran os!"
msg_kalenz_die="Argh! Jeg er færdig!"
msg_konrad_die="Vi er fortabte, for jeg er besejret!"
msg_lisar_die="Jeg kan ikke tro på, at det skulle ende sådan!"
msg_nw_8="Der falder mere sne. Vi må gøre en ende på denne kamp hurtigt. Fremad, mænd!"
msg_orc10_10="Here we are, my friends.  Earl Lanbec'h and his kind is on our tails, we must hurry up."
msg_orc10_20="Hurry up!  The southern bridge is going to explode! Retreat! "
msg_orc10_31="We've had too much casualties to be able to resist to humans, we have no choice but surrender."
msg_orc1_1="Look, companions!  Those orcs don't imagine they are living their last day.  Let's slay all of them and give this land back to our people!"
msg_orc1_10="Argh!  I die!  But other humans will go and slay you, filthy orcs!"
msg_orc1_11="Hurrah!  Victory!"
msg_orc1_12="We are victorious this time, but humans are organizing themselves in a huge army.  We have just defeated a vanguard, they are coming massively."
msg_orc1_13="What should be do, chief?"
msg_orc1_14="We must lead my people to a safe place and ask for assistance from the Great Council.  Some of them live in Barag Gor in the lands of the free tribes.  We must leave, now!"
msg_orc1_15="But the free tribes are beyond the Mountains of Haag.  These moutains are infested of dwarves and wild trolls."
msg_orc1_16="We have no choice, we shall pass.  The trolls have been our allies in the past--maybe they can help us.  Hurry up, we must leave now."
msg_orc1_2="We are attacked by these humans!  Hurry up, we must defend our fathers' land!"
msg_orc1_3="The battle begun."
msg_orc2_1="We have nearly crossed the mountains.  I feel the lands of the free tribes are near now.  But beware, there are dwarves and wild trolls around.  Hurry up!  I can see the sign post that indicates their land."
msg_orc2_10="Argh!  I'm done.  My people is dommed!"
msg_orc2_11="Father!  Oh no!"
msg_orc2_12="Filthy dwarves!  Now I'm to kill you to the last!"
msg_orc2_13="Oh no, I'm defeated."
msg_orc2_14="My son!  I should have never brought him to this fight.  Now we are to return to our caverns, and we will never go back."
msg_orc2_15="Our troll friends are over.  Without them there is no hope."
msg_orc2_16="Argh!  I die!"
msg_orc2_2="What are these orcs doing here?  They should be too tired to live."
msg_orc2_20="We've succeeded!  We've passed through the Mountains of Haag!  Look at these green hills!  The land of the free tribes is near now.  I can see the walls of Barag-Gor in the distance."
msg_orc2_21="Blemaker, many thanks for your help in this fight.  Would you like to join us in our journey with your son?  Your help would be very appreciated!"
msg_orc2_22="Father, I'd like to join them.  Would you mind it?"
msg_orc2_23="My son, you're old enough to discover the world.  Me, I have to stay here.  But take care, there are plenty of creatures that seek our end, like elves or humans.  They are as clever as merciless."
msg_orc2_24="Thanks, father.  Don't worry, I'll take care of myself."
msg_orc2_25="We've succeeded!  We've passed through the Mountains of Haag!  Look at these green hills!  The land of the free tribes is near now.  I can see the walls of Barag-Gor in the distance."
msg_orc2_26="Grüü, many thanks for your help in this fight.  I'm sorry for your father.  Would you like to join us in our journey?  Your help would be very appreciated!"
msg_orc2_27="My father would have come to help you.  I would insult his memory not to help you.  I come!"
msg_orc2_3="I've never pushed so far, we are crossing the border of the Black Eye lands."
msg_orc2_4="Look!  Dwarves are fighting against orcs!"
msg_orc2_5="Father, we should help them.  Orcs are our allies."
msg_orc2_6="I don't know if we should do that.  Orcs have been our allies in the past, but they have always treated us as fools."
msg_orc2_7="But Father, we don't know what they are seeking there, maybe this is a good occasion to get rid of these dwarves."
msg_orc2_8="You are right, my son.  We will help our orcish friends.  But take care of you ... I would be desperate if something would happen to you."
msg_orc3_1="Here is Barag Gor."
msg_orc3_10="You are right, we have to go to a safer place.  You have helped us.  Would you help us again and escort us to the Harbour of Tirigaz?"
msg_orc3_11="Yes, I need to ask for assistance from whole council.  I'm with you."
msg_orc3_12="Excellent.  This is a dangerous journey, as we have to take a road near the elvish forest.  This is the road near that yellow farm."
msg_orc3_13="They are retreating at last!"
msg_orc3_14="Yes, but I can see that more are pouring from the forest.  We are not in safety."
msg_orc3_15="You are right, we have to leave to a safer place.  You have helped us.  Would you help us again and escort us to the Harbour of Tirigaz?"
msg_orc3_16="Yes, I need to ask for assistance to the whole council.  I'm with you."
msg_orc3_17="Excellent.  This is a dangerous journey, as we have to take a road near the elvish forest.  This is the road near this yellow farm."
msg_orc3_19="We've made it!  Our journey is still long.  Hurry up, my people!"
msg_orc3_2="Oh no!  They are besieged by elves.  We must help our brothers to get rid of this mob.  But these filthy elves are so numerous."
msg_orc3_20="They are destroying our castle!  To my rescue my merry Elves!"
msg_orc3_21="At your service, Etheliel.  Let push these evil creatures back to their quag!"
msg_orc3_3="I have a subtle plan, chief."
msg_orc3_4="Which plan?"
msg_orc3_5="We go and we kill all of them.  What do you think?"
msg_orc3_6="..."
msg_orc3_7="Then, Kapou'e launched his desperate attack to stop the siege of Barag Gor."
msg_orc3_7_1="Freedom!  Many thanks, Son of The Black Eye.  I'm Jetto, master of assassins, now you can count on the assassins guild to help you in your quest!"
msg_orc3_8="They are retreating at last!"
msg_orc3_9="We're not out of the woods yet.  I can see that more are pouring from the forest.  We are not in safety."
msg_orc4_1="Ahhh, I'm so tired.  It was a good idea to halt in such a quiet place."
msg_orc4_10="The day is coming, these night creatures will soon return to the pit."
msg_orc4_11="Grüü, are you forgeting we are ALSO night creatures?"
msg_orc4_12="Err... well..."
msg_orc4_2="It is too quiet.  Just plain boring."
msg_orc4_3="Shut up, I just heard something."
msg_orc4_4="You're right.  I can see something is moving in these hills.  Looks like there are undead there."
msg_orc4_5="Excellent!  It is time for exercise!"
msg_orc4_6="Hmmm, what neat bottle!  What is it?"
msg_orc4_7="It is written H.O.L.Y W.A.T.E.R"
msg_orc4_8="I'm thirsty ... *gulp* *gulp*"
msg_orc4_9="Ahhh, that was yummy!"
msg_orc5_1="So here is Tirigaz."
msg_orc5_10="I love this strategy, chief!"
msg_orc5_12="Pillage!  Let's plunder these orcs!"
msg_orc5_2="Looks like they are to be facing attack from pirates of the High Sea.  We should help them."
msg_orc5_22="Aaaargh!  I die!"
msg_orc5_23="Finally you paid for all of what you did to my Orc brothers!"
msg_orc5_24="We're back! We have bad news, the humans are regrouping on our tails, we must leave."
msg_orc5_25="But where is the rest of the council?  We haven't made such a long journey to flee!"
msg_orc5_26="We had news from them, all of them fled to the East, near the Mourned Hills.  I think we should go for them as soon as possible and evacuate this city."
msg_orc5_27="But it is beyond the Desert of Death, which is full of poisonous giant scorpions and outlaws.  And bypassing it would take ages!  Not to mention after this desert, we'll have to cross the Silent Forest!"
msg_orc5_28="So we have no choice ... I've never tasted scorpions but sure, this journey promises to be fun."
msg_orc5_3="I propose that Gork, you and I call for reinforcements."
msg_orc5_4="Call for reinforcements?  Do you mean you don't want to fight for our brothers?  Are you a coward, Vraurk?"
msg_orc5_5="Me?  I'll show you if I'm a coward!"
msg_orc5_6="It is not time for quarreling!  I'm to contain them, go find reinforcements."
msg_orc5_7="This is a wise choice.  Good luck, son of the Black Eye."
msg_orc5_8="Haha!  Our plan is going well, let surround them on land while our allies attack them from sea!"
msg_orc5_9="We are attacked from both sides!  Grüü, hold them while I run to Tirigaz to find forces to counter attack.  Although we can't defeat those pirates without naval forces, we can wipe humans out of this region."
msg_orc6_1="It's been two days since we entered this desert.  I have never been so hot and we have nearly finished our food."
msg_orc6_10="We've done it!  Now we need some rest, before we continue our journey."
msg_orc6_2="I'm hungry and we found no giant scorpion yet.  I'm sure it would be delicious."
msg_orc6_3="I hope we won't find one!  They are terrible armored beasts and your troll clubs are useless against their heavy shells."
msg_orc6_4="I've been told the best way to defeat them is to attack their eyes with sharp blades.  But I hope too we won't meet them."
msg_orc6_5="The sun is rising, we should resume our journey and find this oasis mentioned on the map before the sun get high."
msg_orc6_6="Stay alert!  This oasis is known to be a den of outlaws and desert pillagers."
msg_orc7_1="So here is the Silent Forest ... why is it named that way?  Is it really that silent?"
msg_orc7_10="We've done it!  Now we need some rest, before we continue our journey."
msg_orc7_11="No more elves?  Where are you cowards!?"
msg_orc7_12="Don't shout that loud, stupid troll.  Do you remember we are in the Silent Forest?  Perhaps there more are to come."
msg_orc7_13="I don't think so.  They must have fled.  Now that this forest has been cleared of elves, we can have a rest and then continue our journey."
msg_orc7_2="It has not always been that silent.  A lot of hunters from tribes used to hunt there and fish in the Bork river.  But now, no one would enter there unless forced."
msg_orc7_3="Some people say these woods are haunted."
msg_orc7_4="The fact is that few people entered this forest and returned home safe.  Most likely, this forest is full of elvish renegades."
msg_orc7_5="Anyway, we need some rest.  We are sufficiently armed to cope with a bunch of elvish poachers.  If we ever meet some, I'll push them into the Bork river with great delight."
msg_orc7_6="What is that?  Orcs entering our forest?  Fools!  None of them will return alive!"
msg_orc7_7="I agree.  We'll attack them on both sides."
msg_orc9_1="At last, here are the mourned hills!  I hope everything will be OK."
msg_orc9_10="Exasperated, Kapou'e launched an attack on his fellow orc Shan Taum the Smug."
msg_orc9_2="Why?"
msg_orc9_21="Nooo!  Don't kill me, I surrender to you little earthworm."
msg_orc9_3="Only trolls don't know that these lands are ruled by Shan Taum the Smug, who was a rival for Black Eye Karun."
msg_orc9_30="What is this?  Are you mad!?  Humans are to besiege our fortress at Prestim and you are fighting each other!?"
msg_orc9_31="Well, ermmm..."
msg_orc9_32="Kapou'e, rumors tell you made a long trip to seek assistance from us, and escorting Pirk, Gork and Vraurk.  The council is grateful for that."
msg_orc9_33="I know what you want from us but I'm afraid we can't help you."
msg_orc9_34="Really?  But my people..."
msg_orc9_36="You don't understand.  Orcs have been divided for ages.  The only one who gave us some unity was your father, Black Eye Karun.  Hearing rumors from your exploits, we understood you are a worthy son of your father."
msg_orc9_37="This is true.  Now we are pressured from all sides by humans and elves; we need a leader that can unite all banners.  This one is YOU!"
msg_orc9_38="Well, I'm not sure I deserve that..."
msg_orc9_39="Did you hear?  There is a battle waiting for us at Prestim!"
msg_orc9_4="I doubt he would welcome the son of the Black Eye."
msg_orc9_40="Kapou'e, if Prestim falls, humans will have a strong bridgehead on this side of the river and your people won't be safe.  You are the only one that can help us defend Prestim!"
msg_orc9_41="Leave your people here Kapou'e--they are safe for the moment--and go defend Prestim.  In the meantime, now that the council is complete again, we will decide if we have to form the Great Horde again and give you the leadership on it."
msg_orc9_5="Who is that?  Kapou'e!  What are you doing in my lands you ridiculous born loser?"
msg_orc9_6="Hold on, Shan Taum. We are not here to quarrel, we are here to escort our brothers and to deliberate about what we have to do."
msg_orc9_7="Bwahaha!  You are nothing!  Where is your land?  You became a beggar.  You are as pathetic as your father!"
msg_orc9_8="How can you talk that way about my father, you miserable coward?!  I'll make a mug with your skull!"
msg_orc9_9="Really?  What would you drink with it?  Mint cordial?"
msg_orc_10_1="Reinforcements, at least!  Whoever you are, you are welcome in Prestim!  The fortified bridge over the Gork river has been taken this morning by a small commando of elves, we already tried to assault it twice without success."
msg_orc_10_2="Ah!  They are no match against my mace."
msg_orc_10_3="There is worse, our scouts reported that our saurians allies led by Inarix are still blocked on the other side of the river some miles away. They won't be able to cross the river."
msg_orc_10_4="Elves and dwarves have joined humans against us and are camping near.  Humans will arrive soon.  We must destroy the southern bridge on the river."
msg_orc_10_5="We must do something!"
msg_orc_10_6="I know what we must do.  Kill elves and help Inarix cross."
msg_orc_10_7="It won't be that easy!  Our enemies are well entrenchered.  And don't forget, we will sabotage the southern bridge as soon as the bulk of Saurians army will have crossed!"
msg_orc_10_8="Each warrior trapped on the bridge or on the other side of the river will perish!"
msg_orc_17_1="We're safe, finally.  Hurry up Kapou'e, come with us, we need to reach Tirigaz as soon as possible."
msgcrossroads1="Bliv på ruten! Skovene her er ikke sikre!"
msgcrossroads2="Tag jer i agt for skoven! Der gemmer sig mange Orker der, og de er klar til at overfalde jer!"
msgcrossroads3="Her er vi nået til det store vejkryds. Vi skal gå mod nordøst."
msgcrossroads4="Pas på! Disse skove er ikke sikre! Asheviere har lejet Orker til at bevogte disse veje på grund af deres strategiske vigtighed. Vi er nødt til at slås for at komme forbi her."
msgcrossroads5="Jamen så lad os slås! Sæt i gang."
msgcrossroads6="Sejren er vores, mænd. Lad os fortsætte nordøst!"
msgnw_1="Denne vinter er bidende kold! Måske skulle vi gøre holdt her og hvile lidt."
msgnw_10="Og da, efter mange dages hvil, fortsatte vores flok endnu engang sin rejse mod Dværge-riget..."
msgnw_2="Gøre holdt og hvile? Min herre, vi er nødt til at træde raskt til for at nå Ildscepteret, hvis det ikke skal falde i hænderne på vores fjender!"
msgnw_3="Vi har kæmpet os igennem en hård march, lige siden vi blev angrebet af de levende døde i den fæle dal. Nu er vinteren på vej over os, og vi har brugt de fleste af vores penge. Dette land ser frodigt nok ud, vi kan da vel bosætte os her vinteren over!"
msgnw_4b="Ja, lad os hvile lidt! Jeg er sikker på, der er mange udfordringer forude, og jeg tror ikke, jeg i mange dage kunne udholde endnu en udfordring på linie med at nå over den flod."
msgnw_5="Vi er på jagt efter Ildscepteret, rigets skæbne er i vores hænder, og i mennesker vil stoppe og hvile? Fremad, siger jeg!"
msgnw_6="De har ret, Kalenz. Jeg havde forventet at få fat i det scepter inden for en måne, men sådan skal det ikke være. Vores soldater vil begynde at desertere, hvis vi ikke hviler snart. Men i disse vilde nordlige lande må vi kæmpe for bare at få retten til at hvile. Se mod nord! Disse fæle orker vil ikke tillade os at hvile i fred!"
msgnw_7="Jamen så vil vi flå kontrollen over landet ud af hænderne på dem. Til våben, mænd!"
msgnw_8="Sejren er vores! Vi har sikret landet for Orkerne. Nu kan vi hvile her, mens den kolde vinter er over os."
msgnw_9="Lad os dog ikke hvile for længe, venner. Vi skal stadig nå de ældgamle dværgiske lande, før vores fjender når dem."
msgsnowplains1a="Disse snemarker var engang mit folks hjem. Vi rejste videre for århundreder siden. Legenderne lyder på, at der blev efterladt et storslået ildsværd."
msgsnowplains2="Dette sværd kunne vise sig nyttigt på vores videre rejse. Det må være i en af byerne foran os."
msgswamp1="Der hviler en forbandelse over dette land. De Levende Lig har boet her i årevis og samlet storslåede hære og rigdomme."
msgswamp2="De Levende Lig er overalt i dette sumpland. Jeg håber, det var et klogt valg at følge denne vej."

nelves_10="Vær hilset, Eonihar, gamle ven! Hvorfor har du ledt efter os?"
nelves_11="Da min herre fik nys om jeres ankomst, sendte han spejdere ud for at finde jer! Der er fare på færde. Fra syd kommer Wesnoths mænd og leder efter jer, og mod nord står Orkerne parat til at kæmpe imod dem!"
nelves_12a="Trouble? What kind of trouble?"
nelves_13a="We have sighted a great host to the south, a host of the men of Wesnoth. And we believe they are looking for you! There is not a moment to lose. You must make haste to the Elven forest. Only there will you be safe!"
nelves_14a="I only hope we can avoid them. We will have to bear north-east."
nelves_15a="That is not all, my lord. The foul Orcs have heard of the coming of these men, and are even now gathering a great host to oppose them to the north! It is now certain that there will be a great battle."
nelves_16a="This sounds very dangerous. Perhaps we should retreat to the West, and hide until the battle is over?"
nelves_17a="I think these wild lands are too dangerous for that! Anyhow...I expected you to be on the side of Wesnoth, Princess?"
nelves_18a="I am an honorable princess, not an imposter like you! I promised that I would be on your side until we made it out of these lands, and I will keep my promise!"
nelves_19a="Sir, madam, there is no time to lose! You must make it East, to the home of my people. Only there will you be safe!"
nelves_2="Efter at have været i dette vildnis i så lang tid, skal det blive godt at hvile ud!"
nelves_20a="Come then, Konrad, let us go."
nelves_21a="My lord has begun assembling a party of Elves to come and escort you into the forest. Beware, for we are all in great danger!"
nelves_22="Greetings, Elf-friend! Welcome to Emetria. You must take shelter here until the battle passes. If you stay with me here for a little while, we will all be safe."
nelves_23="Thank you, Lord El'rien. The hospitality of the North Elves is as generous as of your kin in the South! My men will help you hold out against our enemies."
nelves_24="Elf-friends, you have made it to safety!"
nelves_25="El'rien, we have the Scepter of Fire with us! We must escort them to Elensia!"
nelves_26="Indeed. We will escort you to our capital, where we will make Council."
nelves_3a="But there is a great fog around us again! We don't know what dangers may lie ahead!"
nelves_4a="So long as we move ahead with caution and prudence, I am sure we will reach the safety and hospitality of the Elves."

undeadmages_2="At last, I have reached the main road. Unless I am far off my course, I should find the Tower of Kaleon here, filled with the secrets of ancient mages. Soon they shall all be mine, and my power will be great enough to invade Wesnoth."

undeadmages_4="Accursed and dreadful one, know that we mages, guardians of the Tower of Kaleon, shall bar your way with all our spells! Flee now and you may survive."

undeadskull_1="After Gwiti destroyed his brother, he planned to march on Wesnoth to gain his revenge. But a Dark Spirit came to counsel him..."
undeadskull_10="It is not your banner, and it never was! That skull has marked it as mine since long ago."
undeadskull_11="Argh! This is only half of the skull!"
undeadskull_12="This skull is powerless!"
undeadskull_13="That is not the skull of Agarash!"
undeadskull_15="It's been a long time since I fought anything myself!"
undeadskull_2="Gwitiii...Gwiti!"
undeadskull_3="A Dark Spirit? Surely this is my token of mastery of the undead!"
undeadskull_4="Gwiti, do not yet march in pursuit of your revenge. First, you shall go south, against the orcs, and there find the Skull of Agarash."
undeadskull_5="What is the Skull of Agarash? Tell me more."
undeadskull_6="Do you see the three orc clans of this land? Their banners are topped with skulls, as is their custom. But one of these is the Skull of Agarash - which once was mine. Take it and your power will grow greater by far."
undeadskull_8="What? I can't die! I've done so already! Noooo!"
undeadskull_9="Oh, no! The undead hordes have taken my banner!"

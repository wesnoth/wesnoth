choice1="Well, thank you for helping me get back to the surface, but now I must take what is mine!"
choice10="No, I was thinking....and I don't really want to kill you. I have what I came to get, anyhow. How about if you promise to never come south of the great river, I spare your life?"
choice11="With all respect, princess, I think it would be us doing the sparing, Sceptre or no Sceptre. Us doing the sparing, again, I might add."
choice12="Such words in the presence of royalty! Do you want me to fry you, Elf?"
choice13="Friends, peace! Though we are out of the tunnels, we are hardly safe. We are in the arid, wild north lands. We barely know where we are. Behold to the north, there are orcs. Look to the south, there are dark hordes. We must remain at peace with one another, or else all perish"
choice14="I suppose that helping each other would be mutually beneficial for a while longer. But what should we do? How should we defend ourselves?"
choice15="We have a choice to make. To the north passed the Orcs are the snow plains. To the south, beyond the Lichen armies is the Swamp of Dread."
choice16="We certainly must go either north or south, for we must get out of this valley. Then we will be able to seek refuge in the ancient home of the North Elves."
choice2="You still want to fight me do you, princess?"
choice3="Did you think I was just playing around? I need to take my inheritance!"
choice4="It is not so simple! We are back on the surface, but we are hardly safe. We barely know where we are, and Look to the north! There are orcs about! Look to the south, there are the hordes of the undead!"
choice5="Indeed there are. We will have to fight our way out. Are you for us, princess, or against us?"
choice6="Perhaps us remaining allies for a little longer is in both our best interests. But I do want that Sceptre, and someday I will have it!"
choice7="Then we must devise a battle plan."
choice8="Well, we got out alive."
choice9="Yes we did. Now I suppose you want to use the Sceptre against me, princess?"
hasty_1="Where are we? Which way now? I am tired of this darkness!"
hasty_10="I see we have little choice but to help each other. We shall help each other until we reach the surface again, agreed?"
hasty_11="Very well, I will ensure you will reach the surface again, or else we shall all perish together, princess."
hasty_12="But once we escape from this hole, I have a score to settle with you!"
hasty_13="Well, we have helped each other survive so far princess. Now let us continue together, shall we?"
hasty_14="Yes indeed, we agreed that we would help each other get out of these pits alive, did we not? We will pool our resources. Here is my purse, full of gold."
hasty_15="You receive 500 pieces of gold!"
hasty_16="Thank you, princess. Come men, let us find the Sceptre!"
hasty_2="I am not sure. Let me think for a moment."
hasty_3="On guard!"
hasty_4="What in the world are you doing here?"
hasty_5="Tracking you down of course! You have escaped for the last time!"
hasty_6="Foolish girl! We are in the deepest of caverns, probably surrounded by all manner of creatures, and you still want to fight with us? You will bring us all to our deaths!"
hasty_7="Don't try to trick me! I know why you have come here! But I will end you and your treason here, and then get the Sceptre, and return to see the daylight again!"
hasty_8="Surprise! Die you sun-lovers!"
hasty_9="Now we are surrounded! Do you still want to fight us, princess? Surely that would lead to both our dooms!"
msg11_5b="I am hesitant to enter. It will be so difficult in the darkness!"
msg12_1="It's so dark in here! I can hardly see!"
msg12_10="You go too far! I am Kalenz, a mighty Elvish lord! How dare such as you, snivelling around in his tunnel, dare to call me a coward?"
msg12_11="Peace friends! Peace! The evil Orcs roam the lands above us, must we also fight among ourselves?"
msg12_12="Very well! Who are you? Explain your presence here then, human. Why have you risked life and limb to come to Knalga, the home of the Dwarves?"
msg12_13="Well, we....we..."
msg12_14="We have come so that an heir may claim his inheritance. That a king may claim his throne. We seek the Sceptre of Fire."
msg12_15="The Sceptre of Fire? Are you out of your mind? Surely you speak but only in jest!"
msg12_16="We jest not, friend. We seek the Sceptre of Fire. We seek the help of the Dwarves in finding it. Choose to help us not, if you so wish. We will find it, whether you help us or not."
msg12_17="Your speech is like that of a fool. No-one even knows if the Sceptre of Fire exists. Who is this heir, this king that you speak of, anyhow?"
msg12_18="I am, Sir."
msg12_19="You, haha, this boy that stands before me is the king of Wesnoth? Haha! I haven't had such a laugh in a long time. And whom are you, old man?"
msg12_2="It is dark indeed. We shall have to light torches, and tread slowly and warily. Hopefully there are still Dwarves down here who can aid us!"
msg12_20="I am Delfador. Delfador the Great, Arch Mage to King Garard, and Protector of his heir."
msg12_21="You....you are Delfador? I have seen Delfador when I was but a young Dwarf, and I will tell you old man, you are not Delfador. Men! Take these liars out of my sight. Delfador perished many years ago."
msg12_22="I am Delfador the Great! Any who dare oppose me shall perish!"
msg12_23="You...you really are Delfador! But we had news that you were dead, years ago!"
msg12_24="They thought I was dead. They hoped I was dead. Yet still, still I live."
msg12_25="And you really think you can find, the Sceptre of Fire?"
msg12_26="Yes we do. If you help us, friend, all the treasures of Knalga that we find are yours. We want only the Sceptre. It will be dangerous. Make no mistake about that: Dwarves will be killed, perhaps many Dwarves. But surely it is better than hiding from the Orcs like worms."
msg12_27="You are right, friend. I will put my best men at your disposal. We know not where the Sceptre is though. Legend says it is hidden in the northern tunnels."
msg12_28="Then to the northern tunnels we shall go!"
msg12_29="Hmm...there seems to be a secret passage behind these rocks!"
msg12_3="Indeed. Us Elves are not well-skilled in these dark pits."
msg12_30="There is a great fortune in this chest of treasure! I can count two hundred pieces of gold!"
msg12_5="Who are these that approach? Surface-dwellers! On guard men!"
msg12_6="We come in peace, friends. We come in peace!"
msg12_7="Oh do you? I see you are even accompanied by Elves. Can us Dwarves not live in peace without the treacherous Elves coming to bother us?"
msg12_8="Why such harsh words, Dwarf? Elves have never done you any harm."
msg12_9="Never done us any harm? Why I was there myself, when the Elves did not come to honor our alliance. Many Dwarves were slaughtered, and you cowardly Elves did nothing to help!"
msg13_1="Alright Delfador, now that I have claimed the Scepter of Fire I am going to hold you to your promise."
msg13_10="I knew you should've helped him!"
msg13_11="So this is my fault!?! Nevermind! Let's just kill them!"
msg13_12="Hail!  We've come in response to your message, the Queen has given us specific orders to help you deal with these humans once and for all. We're the vanguard that's been sent out from an entire army that's been ordered to deal with these miscreants!"
msg13_13="This is a bad turn of events! We must finish them quickly and flee!  We are not capable of dealing with an entire army dedicated to wiping us out in our current condition!"
msg13_14="We've slain our opposition! Now let us make haste!"
msg13_15="They're attacking me boss! I gotta defend myself!"
msg13_16="They're attacking me boss! I gotta defend myself!"
msg13_2="Which one?"
msg13_3="The sign says 'Guest's quarters'"
msg13_4="Very well Konrad.  But the orcs must have contacted Asheviere about our trip into the mines, and I doubt she will trust them to take care of the job.  So make haste, and dispatch these beasts quickly, lest reinforcements arrive."
msg13_5="The human and his friends have returned!  I will deal with them myself!"
msg13_6="If your sure boss..."
msg13_7="COURSE I'm sure worm! Do as your told!"
msg13_8="Alright, alright! Sorry boss!"
msg13_9="They killed the boss!"
msg13_9a="Who goes there? Friend or foe?"
msg13_9b="We are desperately trying to rid these tunnels of the foul Orcs! Please help us in our quest."
msg13_9c="Ah, a foul Orc! Let us rid these tunnels of its kind!"
msg13_9d="I did not know that the undead were in these pits!"
msg13_9e="Who is this foul enemy that we fight?"
msg13_9f="I am Lionel. I am the Lost General. I will avenge myself upon you all!"
msg13_9g="Avenge? What have we done to you that you must avenge?"
msg13_9h="Lionel? A General? I remember that name..."
msg13_9i="Remember me do you? Aye. I was the king's finest general, sent down to these pits to retrieve the Sceptre. But the Orcs trapped me and my men in this cavern, to starve to death. The Dwarves were no help, leaving me to die. Now I will get revenge on you all!"
msg13_die1="Argh! I am vanquished! But at least by worthy foes, instead of those foul Orcs."
msg13_die2="Rest in peace, Lionel. The poor, lost general."
msg13_die3="Though I am destroyed, my mission must be completed. Friends, the Sceptre further North of here, deep in the caverns. Better fortune to you in finding it than there was to me."
msg1b_1="We should be able to board a ship at Blackwater Port, but it seems the Orcs are heading there too. One of my old apprentices has settled in these lands - I am sure he will help us!"
msg1b_10="I could offer you a ship - I sent it to the open sea with the elder and the children, but it should arrive back in port soon."
msg1b_11="Thank you, sir."
msg1b_11b="I only hope that we will do as well the next time the evil Orcs attack us."
msg1b_12="We should embark now."
msg1b_13="I failed to the Blackwater port people...."
msg1b_14="Without his help, we will be unable to use the ships, there is no hope..."
msg1b_2="Defaldor, some Orcs are following our trail! We must make haste!"
msg1b_3="Delfaldor, my old master, your arrival bring us the light of hope.
We heard the news that the orcs were attacking the elvish woods and some of them where headed here to attack us also, but our defenses are still weak."
msg1b_4="We will help you fight them off."
msg1b_5a="I shall send one of my mages to aid you. Recruit more mages, and perhaps some horsemen, who have fought very well for us against the crown. I need a few days to summon aid."
msg1b_6="The defenses are now summoned."
msg1b_7="Geeee!! Too many mages, we had better retreat now!"
msg1b_8="Thank you for the help, friends."
msg1b_9="We are seeking transport to the isle of Anduin."
msg3_29="Very well. Until we meet again, my dear friend!"
msg3_30="Farewell, prince."
msg4_moredie="Fight on against the undead without me, friends!"
msg5_12="Very well, you may join us."
msg7_12c="It greatly saddens me that Moremirmu was slain on the field, after he returned to help us."
msg7_13a="The land of Wesnoth is not safe for us. The Queen's forces reach every corner. We must make haste to the north lands, across the great river. Let us go quickly!"
msg7_13b="It is both my duty and pleasure, my lord! We were dining with some royal guards of the princess, taking a rest from our pilgrimage, when they spoke of how you were tricked into travelling these dangerous lands. We could do nothing but help you!"
msg9_a6="They have made it away! I cannot believe it! We must make chase after them over the river! We will meet again, foul imposter!"
msg9_a7="Do you think she's really going to chase us Delfador?"
msg9_a8="It surely looks like she will try, but the sea creatures will make it difficult for her. We must continue onward. If she makes it across before winter, then so be it!"
msg_doors_lisar="Whew! We make our way through the dangerous fog of the mountains, and now there is all this chaos before us! Come on men! We must make it into the mines, for they are still ahead of us!"
msg_konrad_die="We are vanquished, for I have been defeated!"
msgcrossroads1="Stay on the path!"
msgcrossroads2="Stay out of the forrest!"
msgnw_1="This winter is bitterly cold! Perhaps we should stop here and rest a while."
msgnw_10="And so after many days of rest, the party set out once again for the Dwarven kingdom..."
msgnw_2="Stop and rest? My lord, we must go hard after the Sceptre of Fire, lest it fall into the hands of our enemies!"
msgnw_3="We have beaten a hard march ever since we were besieged by the undead in that foul valley. Now winter bears down upon us, and we have spent most of our money. This land looks fertile enough: surely we can settle here for the winter!"
msgnw_4b="Yes, let us rest a while! I am sure there are many challenges ahead, and I do not think I could endure another challenge equal to the fording of the river for many days."
msgnw_5="We are chasing the Sceptre of Fire, the fate of the realm is in our hands, and you humans want to stop and rest? Onward I say!"
msgnw_6="They are right, Kalenz. I had wanted to attain the Sceptre within a moon, but it is not to be. Our soldiers will begin to desert if we don't rest soon. But in these wild north lands, we must fight even for the right to rest. Look to the north! Those foul orcs will not allow us to rest in peace!"
msgnw_7="Then we shall wrest control of the land from them. To arms men!"
msgnw_8="Victory is ours! We have secured the land from the Orcs. Now we can rest here while the cold winter passes."
msgnw_9="Let us not rest for too long though, friends: we must still reach the ancient Dwarven lands before our foes do."
msgsnowplains1="These fields of snow were once home of the Ice Elves. They moved on many decades ago. Legends say the left a great sword of fire behind."
msgsnowplains2="This sword may prove useful on our journy ahead. It must be in one of the towns before us."
msgswamp1="This land is cursed. The Lichen have lived here for years amassing great armies and fortunes."
msgswamp2="The Lichen are all over this swamp. I hope I have made a wise choice to come down this path."
msgswamp3="Each of the Lichen leaders will have a pile of gold you can take, if they are defeated. Don't stretch you armies to thin though, we still must pass threw this swamp to the north."
scep1="The Sceptre has to be getting close now! Where shall we go?"
scep2="Yes, I feel it is near here! We must search for it carefully."
sceptre10="I think I know what I'm doing. Come, let us go!"
sceptre3="Here it is at last, I have the Sceptre!"
sceptre4="So it is in our hands! Now let us leave this stinking pit."
sceptre5="I think that if we travel just a little north, we might be able to get out."
sceptre6="At last! I have the Sceptre!"
sceptre7="Indeed. You managed to reach it Li'sar. I hope you shall use it wisely."
sceptre8="Well my first use for it is going to be to help us get out of this hole! I hope you consider that wise."
sceptre9="The Sceptre makes its wielder powerful, but hardly immortal, child. Use it prudently. Now come, I believe there is an exit to the north!"
und1_1="As the sun set over a land far removed from the war that was happening in Wesnoth, a new war was brewing, between brothers..."
und1_10="I... have failed to win this battle, I am defeated. I will not believe it."
und1_11="Die, yes die, and go to the Land of the Dead. Perhaps one day you will be back under my command!"
und1_12="Didn't I tell you so?!"
und1_13="And by my own hands you died!"
und1_14="I am Gwiti the Mighty, prepare to die!"
und1_15="Now you shall die!"
und1_2="Ah, hated brother mine. Look well upon the setting sun, for you shall not live to see another."
und1_3="I did not live to see this one either. I gave up my life for necromancy, same as you, do you remember?"
und1_4="How well I do. But either way, prepare to die... again."
und1_5="I will fight you with all my strength to prevent that, and I was always the stronger of us. Flee now and save your miserable hide before I make it a carpet."
und1_6="Don't be silly! I'm not hairy enough to be a carpet! But your scalp would make a good pillow."
und1_7="What? I can't die! I've done so already! Noooo!"
und1_8="Ha ha ha, did I not tell you it would be so? Perhaps I shall summon your shade to serve me one day... Until then, farewell!"
und1_9="It is over, I am doomed...."

intro_11="Da Delfador hørte ordrene til Asheviere, snek han seg inn i palasset og tok med seg Konrad, den yngste av Garards nevøer, og reddet ham slik fra en sikker død."
intro_12="Delfador tok barnet med seg til skogen i vest, og oppdro ham under beskyttelse av alvene. Delfador kunne bare trist se på mens Asheviere styrte landet med hard hånd og grusomme metoder..."
intro_13="... men en av orkene overlevde lenge nok til å sende bud om nyhetene til dronningen..."
intro_2="Nordboernes hær slo leir ved Galcadar, ved vadestedet Abez, og kongen ledet sine styrker for å møte dem i kamp. Han delte hæren sin i to, og ledet selv den ene halvdelen, men hans egen sønn, kronprinsen  Eldred, ledet den andre."
intro_3="Eldred var en tapper og modig kriger, og en dyktig leder for sine soldater. Dessverre for Garard var han også ambisiøs.....og forræderisk. I kampens hete gikk Eldreds menn mot sin egen konge. Garard ble drept i kamp den dagen, sammen med sin bror og alle sine sønner utenom Eldred."
intro_4="Garards dronning, Asheviere, så på kampen fra en nærliggende ås, og gledet seg over det hun så. Hennes sønn ville sikkert styre på en måte som tilfredsstilte hennes maktsyke sinn bedre enn hennes mann hadde gjort."
intro_5="Nordboernes konge inngikk gladelig fred med Eldred mot betaling. Eldred proklamerte seg selv konge, og ledet hæren sin tilbake til Weldyn."
intro_6="Men Garards erketrollmann, Delfador, klarte å flykte fra slaget. Han red raskt tilbake og nådde Weldyn først. Der mønstret han en styrke av lojalister for å kjempe mot Eldred, og hevne kongens død."
intro_7="Eldred gikk i kamp med klar beskjed fra moren: ikke kjemp mot noen andre, verken stor eller liten, utenom den gamle trollmannen, hvis hode skulle hogges av."
intro_8="Eldred møtte sannelig Delfador ansikt til ansikt i kamp. Sverd slo mot stav. Den vise trollmannen mot den unge, sterke, selvgode krigeren."

msg10_10="If this is true, Konrad, perhaps we should take another route and go around the mountain, rather then to try and defeat these new foes."
msg10_11="What say you, Delfador?"
msg10_12="No! We do not have the time to waste, we make for top of the pass, beware of mountain trolls, and do not stray too close to the water!"
msg10_13="The shinsplitters will aid you in your quest, look, they arise from the villages to the east, the mighty shinsplitters!!! To battle!"
msg10_2="Look Konrad, before us lies the great road built by the dwarves!"
msg10_20="Well, we have defeated our foes let us hope the mountain does not defeat us!"
msg10_21="I wish you all the best on your journey, I must return to my village and take care of my family, dwarven hospitality will welcome you, wherever you go friends!"
msg10_22="Let us move onward!"
msg10_3a="But, I can hardly see, with all this mist around!"
msg10_4b="We must be wary... they say a wizard lives in these mountains, and he does not take kindly to visitors. It is he who causes the mists, to cause travellers to become lost, and then his creatures devour them."
msg10_5b="His....creatures? We must keep to the road men!"
msg10_6b="He is said to be a mighty foe, Konrad. It is said when the dwarves built this road, they disturbed the resting place of the ancient mage, and ever since he and his brother have travelled the mountain, wreacking havoc on the dwarven villages."
msg10_7b="Let us go carefully but quickly then, men!"
msg10_9="Greetings travellers, I am Stalrag, chief of the these villages! I warn you, a great wizard and his trolls are in the mountains and will surely attack, I will summon my tribesmen to aid ye!"
msg10a_20="Aaargh! I am done for! Fight on without me brethren!"
msg11_1="The doors are closed and barred from the inside!"
msg11_10="The legend was true! There are always tentacled creatures hidding in the lakes near the Dwarven Kingdoms"
msg11_11="At last, this is the entrance to the dwarven kingdom."
msg11_12="All can I see are ruins and poor villages."
msg11_13="The poor villagers that lived here trading with the dwarves are now under slavery of the orcs."
msg11_14="Under slavery to the evil orcs? We must liberate them!"
msg11_15="It's not a wise option, our mission is to retreive the Scepter of Fire. If we delay our march here hordes of orcs will surround us."
msg11_16="Konrad, hear the words of Defaldor, we'll be back and then the grip of the orcs will be lifted from the lands."
msg11_17="I'm not happy about this but I see the need to hurry."
msg11_2b="We can't get in! What should we do now?"
msg11_3="It is said that the orcs used an old mine tunnel to surprise the dwarves. It must be that one in the north-east."
msg11_4="We must make it to the mine tunnel then!"
msg11_5a="There is no time for delay or idle chatter, onward!"
msg11_6="The defense of the dwarves should have been strong. Look at those ruined towers!"
msg11_7="The battle outside was fierce and lasted half a year, but the battles inside the tunnels were worse."
msg11_9="A monster was hiding in that lake!"
msg11_9a="Ruarrrrr!!!"
msg1_1="Fourteen years after Asheviere began her reign, she turned her attention to the Elves, whom she despised. Orcish mercenaries were hired and dispatched to bring about the ruin of the Elves."
msg1_10="Let them come. We will fight them with all we have!"
msg1_11="Be careful Konrad! Guard him well, Delfador!"
msg1_12="And so it has begun"
msg1_13="Okay, we have made it this far! But where do we go next?"
msg1_14="We must travel north, and try to make it to the Isle of Anduin. Hopefully there we will find refuge."
msg1_15="Of course you are right, Delfador. But what will become of the Elves here?"
msg1_16="The Elves will fight. They may even prevail. But I fear things do not bode well for them. Let us not speak of it now. Onward!"
msg1_17="Good luck Konrad! Don't worry about us, we will fight as best we can!"
msg1_18="I....I don't think I can make it anymore"
msg1_19="Prince...you must keep fighting! Nooooooo!"
msg1_2="Master Delfador! Look, there are Orcs coming from all directions! What shall we do?"
msg1_20="It is over, I am doomed...."
msg1_21="I have....have failed in my duty to protect the prince, I am defeated"
msg1_22="Don't die! Delfador! Please, you have to stay alive!"
msg1_23="Ugh"
msg1_24="Oh no! We have run out of time, they have arrived with reinforcements..."
msg1_25="Die villain, die!"
msg1_26="Only the foolish oppose me!"
msg1_27="I am Galdrad. You will have to fight me to get any further!"
msg1_28="Only a fool would dare to attack me!"
msg1_28a="I am Delfador the Great, prepare to die!"
msg1_29="Let me through you rogue!"
msg1_3="There are too many to fight. Far too many. We must escape!"
msg1_30="They are destroying our home!"
msg1_31="There can be no looking back. We must go quickly!"
msg1_4="But to where? This is the only home we have! What about the Elves?"
msg1_5="We will fight them, but you must escape, Konrad. It is imperative that you escape!"
msg1_6="We will go north. Perhaps we can reach the Isle of Anduin. If we can make it there, surely we will be safe. Konrad, we must recruit some Elves to help us, and then you must make it to the sign post in the north-west. I will protect you!"
msg1_7="Very well, let us hurry!"
msg1_8="Attack the Elves men, take their villages, let us claim this land for the Queen!"
msg1_9="Haha! We will rip the filthy Elves to pieces!"
msg2_1="And so the party landed on the Isle of Anduin..."
msg2_10="Have you not heard? Many mermen have been captured, and are being farmed as pearl harvesters at the Bay of Pearls. If only someone would rescue them!"
msg2_11="Let us go and rescue them then!"
msg2_12="My lord, it would be very dangerous..."
msg2_13="I believe we could do it. We need to strike back at Asheviere somehow anyway..."
msg2_14="Let us leave after we have rested then."
msg2_2="So this is Anduin. It looks a little....desolate"
msg2_3="I fear so, Konrad. It seems that the Orcs have come even here"
msg2_4="Who is that? Oh, a party of elves has landed, we shall drive them back into the sea!"
msg2_5="I did not think the Orcs would have come here. This island used to be so beautiful. We must recapture it! To arms!"
msg2_6="Greetings friends, thank you for rescuing my island from the Orcs!"
msg2_7="It was our duty, friend. I hope you will grant us refuge here now"
msg2_8="Of course. The Orcs are brutal. Brutal. Especially what they are doing to the poor mermen."
msg2_9="Oh, what are they doing to the mermen?"
msg3_1="So this is the Bay of Pearls. It looks like they have those mermen working hard!"
msg3_10="But...but...how can this be happening to me?"
msg3_11="Who was that idiot?"
msg3_12="Free at last! Now death to the Orcs!"
msg3_13="Now that we are free, together we can defeat our oppressors!"
msg3_13a="Death to the orcs! Come, let us all fight them men!"
msg3_14="Freedom! Now where are those Orcs? Let me at em!"
msg3_15="Thank you for rescuing us! Now we can help you fight the evil Orcs!"
msg3_16="At last, we have freed the mermen. Go back to the ocean and live in peace."
msg3_17="My lord! You may need the help of some of us who have skill in the sea in future. We would like to offer you help, and come with you."
msg3_18="Now where is Delfador? I hope he's ok!"
msg3_19="Ok indeed, friend."
msg3_2="Indeed it does. It also looks like they have many, many troops. I think that I should go around the bay, and distract some of them. You and the rest of our men rescue the mermen!"
msg3_20="There you are! I am so glad you are alright! Now we may have a little rest."
msg3_21="I am afraid there is no time for rest. Konrad, Asheviere has now laid siege to Elensefar, breaking the century-old treaty between Wesnoth and the Elense city-state. If the city falls, there's no telling how many other lands she may swallow up!"
msg3_22="Oh no! What shall we do?"
msg3_23="You must lead our men to the city, and try to help defend it. Or recapture it if it falls before you arrive."
msg3_24="I must do that? But what about you Delfador? You're coming with me right?"
msg3_25="I am afraid not, Konrad. I have come across some important documents, and must make haste with them to the Elven Council. It seems that the time to stop Asheviere is shorter than I had thought."
msg3_26="But Delfador! I can't do it on my own!"
msg3_27="On your own? My lord! We your loyal soldiers will support you!"
msg3_28="You will prevail. I have faith in you. Travel north. Elensefar is but three days travel if you make haste."
msg3_29a="Very well. But how do I get to Elensefar?"
msg3_3="Very well. Be careful!"
msg3_30_farewell="Safe journey to you, Konrad. Until we meet again!"
msg3_4="But boss, why are we only using bats and nagas?"
msg3_5="Because we need to control the seas and the merman folk, and nagas and bats are best for doing that!"
msg3_6="But orcs are the most powerful race in all of..."
msg3_7="Shut up worm! I'm the boss!"
msg3_8="Hahaha! Now orcs will rule over land and sea!"
msg3_9="(Sigh) will someone kill this idiot for me please?"
msg4_1="But the road to Elensefar was a treacherous one. Konrad and his men were set upon by the fiends of the undead."
msg4_10="Surprise! Searching for Mages, all I get is elves!"
msg4_11="The temple seems to be empty."
msg4_12a="It has been an honor to have helped you defeat the undead, my lord. I must now return to my home. I feel that our paths may cross again one day, perhaps when your need against the undead hordes is greater still."
msg4_2="My lord! In yonder ruins there seems to be some movement!"
msg4_3="It looks like there are the undead there! Prepare for battle men!"
msg4_4="To arms!"
msg4_5="Ahh, a party of Elves approaches. Soon we shall have Elven zombies serving us!"
msg4_6="There are some ancient temples to the north-west, I wonder what might be inside them!"
msg4_7="Looks like there is somebody hidden in the temple."
msg4_8="I was hiding in this holy place planning how to defeat the evil undeads, now I with your help, we can destroy them."
msg4_9="Looks like there is somebody hidden in the temple."
msg5_1="The party arrived at Elensefar at last, but found that the city had already fallen to the evil Orcs."
msg5_10="Thieves hmmm? Who says we can trust such as you?"
msg5_11="We would understand if you don't trust us, of course, but it is in both our best interests to rid the city of the Orcs!"
msg5_12a="Hmm...I have to consider this..."
msg5_13="We will serve you well, for we respect the help you are providing to our city. You shall find that there is honor, even among thieves."
msg5_14="Very well, we shall begone then. You shall have to recapture the city without our help!"
msg5_15="The party rested for three days, after which an old friend returned"
msg5_16="Greetings, friends. I see that you have rescued the city! I knew that you could do it."
msg5_17="Delfador! So good to see you! Where have you been?"
msg5_18="I have been meeting with the Great Elven Council. This is Kalenz, a lord of the Northern Elves who came to the Council to offer us the support of the North Elves"
msg5_19="Greetings, friend."
msg5_2="My lord! It seems the city has already fallen!"
msg5_20="Delfador, we have captured this city, but surely Asheviere's men will come and attack us! What should we do?"
msg5_21="The Council has met, and we have decided: we must capture the Sceptre of Fire"
msg5_22="The Sceptre of Fire? What's that?"
msg5_23="During the reign of Garard I, your uncle's father, the dwarves of Knalga agreed to make the king a magnificent scepter. It took their finest smiths years to make it. But soon after it was completed, Orcs invaded the tunnels of Knalga. Now Knalga is in chaos, and though some Dwarves still live in parts of it, always at war with the Orcs, the sceptre was lost somewhere in the great caverns."
msg5_24="Oh, but what has this to do with me?"
msg5_25="Garard II, your uncle, was deciding upon a successor. He issued an edict that whichever member of the royal family could retrieve the Sceptre of Fire would rule the land."
msg5_26="Oh, and you want me to get this sceptre?"
msg5_26a="We will help you get it, my lord."
msg5_27="Time is short. We think that Asheviere is also searching for the Sceptre, to help seal her place as ruler. If you get the Sceptre first though, the people will support you as the king."
msg5_28="Me? The king?"
msg5_29="Yes Konrad. I believe you will be king one day. Now let us make haste!"
msg5_3="This is terrible news! We must retake the city!"
msg5_4="There are so many of them. This will not be easy! And look to the south, it seems that the undead are allied with the Orcs!"
msg5_5="Here come the Elves! With our newly forged alliance with the Orcs, we will crush them with ease!"
msg5_6="We must take the city, and destroy the evil undead before reinforcements arrive!"
msg5_7="In the night, three dark figures crept out of the forest"
msg5_8="Halt! Who goes there? Friend or foe?"
msg5_9="Greetings, friend. We are from the Elensefar Thieves Guild. We would like to help you against the Orcs!"
msg6_1="On the road to Knalga, the party was opposed by the forces of Asheviere"
msg6_10="Halt! You shall not pass!"
msg6_11="My duty is to kill you!"
msg6_12="Get out!"
msg6_13="Protect me!"
msg6_14="Yes, madam!"
msg6_15="Don't move!"
msg6_16="Stay away!"
msg6_17="Don't move!"
msg6_18="They bear down on me quickly! I had better use some magical aid."
msg6_19="They took that village too! I'll make them retreat!"
msg6_2="The Queen has sent me to stop you, you imposter!"
msg6_20="If swords won't destroy them, magic will do."
msg6_21="Fry them!"
msg6_22="You get paid to kill them, so go!"
msg6_23="Somebody! Kill these intruders, now!"
msg6_24="Uggh will kill the slims!"
msg6_25="Ogres! I need more ogres to defeat them!"
msg6_26="Surely an ogre will crush them!"
msg6_27="I surrender! Don't hurt me, imposter."
msg6_28="I said before I'm not an imposter, but if you yield, I will spare your life."
msg6_29="Let me go!"
msg6_3="That's the princess, Li'sar. The daughter of the Queen, and her successor!"
msg6_30="Think about the story of the old king, ask somebody old about it."
msg6_31="The old king? I have heard about that, but I know it's not true. My mother told me."
msg6_32="Your mother has lied to you, child. Now I suggest you reconsider, and either join us, or flee into exile. There will be a great battle soon, and if you are on the wrong side of it, we may not have the opportunity to spare your life a second time."
msg6_33="I'm not a child, and I don't want to talk about it! Now you said you would spare me, so be on your way. The northern road should be safe for you."
msg6_34="Good day, princess. Come men, to the northern road!"
msg6_35="(hehe, little do they know just how many undead have wandered the northern road of late. Surely they are doomed!)"
msg6_36="No! It can't end like this!"
msg6_37="Argh! I have been defeated!"
msg6_38="With Kalenz slain, it is hopeless. We are defeated."
msg6_4="I'm no imposter, it seems that your mother has lied to you about it."
msg6_5="It's no use reasoning. There is only one thing she will understand. To arms!"
msg6_6="This is taking too much time, I best call some reinforcements!"
msg6_7="Maybe I wasn't using enough forces..."
msg6_8="Protect the princess!!!"
msg6_9="Stop!!!"
msg7_1="My lord! This road does not seem as safe as we had hoped, look around us at the hills, there are undead about!"
msg7_10="Whew! They seem to be retreating at last!"
msg7_11="Yes! We have fought them off"
msg7_12a="This place makes me feel uneasy, even with the undead retreating. Where may we go now?"
msg7_12b="Thank you for returning to help us, Moremirmu."
msg7_13c="May he rest peacefully!"
msg7_14a="Indeed! Let us go from here!"
msg7_14b="So, she tricked us into coming this way on purpose! Where may we go now? Which way will be safe for us?"
msg7_14c="He died fighting for you, prince, just as any of us would be willing to die, fighting for you."
msg7_15b="You must get out of the clutches of that vile Queen, my lord. If you take a course, bearing north-east, on past the mountain of gryphons, you will be able to ford the great river at Abez. Make haste though, for you will not be able to ford the river come winter!"
msg7_16b="Thank you for your counsel, good friend! May our paths meet again in happier times!"
msg7_2="Who are these who approach? Let us kill them all!"
msg7_3="To arms men! The undead hordes approach!"
msg7_4="There are just so many! Whatever shall we do?"
msg7_5="Just let us hold them off for as long as we can!"
msg7_6b="I have come once again to aid you friends!"
msg7_7b="White mages? Come to help us? But what are they doing here?"
msg7_8b="That is Moremirmu! He helped us fight Muff Malal, let us hope he can help us once more!"
msg8_1a="What is this place? That is a tall mountain!"
msg8_2b="That is the fabled Gryphon Mountain! We must be careful here, disturbing the gryphons could prove to be dangerous."
msg8_3b="So this is Gryphon Mountain! Maybe we could steal some eggs from the gryphons and breed them as flying mounts? Would that work Delfador?"
msg8_4b="We can try to do that, although it may be dangerous indeed! But perhaps the use of gryphons could help us greatly later on. Anyhow, we do have to pass by this place regardless."
msg8_5b="Well, let's start climbing that mountain!"
msg8_5c="It appears we are not the only ones who are interested in this mountain. Once again the Queen opposes us!"
msg8_5d="Quickly men! Onward!"
msg8_6="We have defeated them! Now what do we do?"
msg8_7="We must continue north. It is too late to return to the safety of Elensefar or Anduin before winter befalls us. Thus we must cross the great river and continue toward the land of the Dwarves. Come let us go!"
msg8_8="With these gryphon eggs we should be able to breed gryphons that will serve us. That will let us hire gryphon riders!"
msg8_9b="Let us continue onward!"
msg9_1="This is the Ford of Abez. When we ford this river, we will be leaving Wesnoth, and entering the lands of the North. The lands the Dwarves once ruled, but which are now filled only with chaos. This is where your father and uncle were betrayed to their deaths, almost nineteen years ago now, Konrad."
msg9_10="That foolish boy killed himself."
msg9_11="What do you mean?"
msg9_12="I mustered men to fight against the traitor-king, and of course Asheviere, the one behind it all. We were out numbered, perhaps four-to-one. In the heat of battle, that boy, that foolish boy, came charging at me, slashing wildly. I had little choice but to end him."
msg9_13b="So it is true, that you did kill him?"
msg9_14b="He did die in battle, at my hand. It is sad that your brothers did not have the opportunity to experience such an 'honorable' death, Konrad."
msg9_16="With all respect my lords, we must make haste. We have to ford the river as a matter of urgency. Look! It seems that the guard towers on the river banks are guarded!"
msg9_17="Look! Some of the southerners, the men of Wesnoth are trying to cross into our lands! We will have to stop them men!"
msg9_18="Isn't there somewhere else we can cross? Maybe upstream?"
msg9_19="Winter bears down on us fast. We have only a few days to make the crossing, and the nearest bridge is far upstream. To be trapped south of the river when winter arrives would be suicidal, Asheviere would have us like rats! Look to the west! Asheviere has a border fort here, and it seems to be full of soldiers! We must cross here, and quickly!"
msg9_19b="There they are! So it is true, they foiled the undead. Now they are trying to leave Wesnoth. We can't let them cross the river. After them men!"
msg9_2="Really? So what happened, Delfador?"
msg9_20a="Not her again! Quick, we must make haste!"
msg9_3="The forces of the king were encamped here. The forces of the north were camped on the north side of the river. For three days and three nights the armies faced each other, neither one willing to ford the river. On the fourth day, the northern armies crossed the river, and attacked us."
msg9_4b="And then....we were defeated?"
msg9_5="We were winning the battle. We were repelling them."
msg9_6="Until the king's son, in the heat of battle, until he turned on the king!"
msg9_7b="But you avenged the murder. You killed the prince, right Delfador?"
msg9_8="When I saw the king betrayed and his banner fall, I fled the battle. Be it wisdom or be it cowardice, I fled the battle, seeing us have no hope that day."
msg9_9b="Oh, but the Elves always told me that you killed the prince, Delfador, even though you never talked about it."
msg9_a1="Ruaarrrrrrrr!"
msg9_a2="What is that?"
msg9_a3="Creatures of the deep are upon us! This may be very dangerous. Quick, we must get to the other side as fast as we can!"
msg9_a4="We have made it across the river safely! Where to now?"
msg9_a5="We must continue north. We must seek help with the northern Dwarves if we are to stand a hope of penetrating into Knalga."

tut1="Ok, så nå er jeg på treningsplassen. Hva skjer?"
tut10="Ja, akkurat! Det er også viktig å prøve og stoppe meg fra å kontrollere landsbyer, og å ta landsbyer jeg kontrollerer fra meg, slik at jeg får så lite gull som mulig."
tut11="Kom igjen, la oss ta noen landsbyer!"
tut12="Hvordan velger jeg hvilken type soldater jeg trenger, Delfador?"
tut13="Du må vurdere egenskapene deres nøye. I begynnelsen trenger du raske enheter for å ta så mange landsbyer som mulig. Senere bør nok krigere utgjøre mesteparten av hæren din. Husk at alle alviske styrker kjemper meget bra i skog. Ryttere er glimrende i åpent lende. Trollmenn er gode som støttespillere, og kan brukes på samme måte som bueskyttere. Hvis trollmennene dine blir mer erfarne, vil de bli svært mektige."
tut14="Når du angriper en fiende kan du velge hvilket våpen du vil bruke, og studere sjansen for å treffe og eventuell skade et vellykket utfall vil gjøre."

tut3="Øhh... ja vel, hvordan begynner jeg?"
tut4="Du har to hundre gullstykker du kan bruke til å betale soldater. Det første du må gjøre er å rekruttere noen soldater til å kjempe for deg (Høyreklikk og velg 'Rekrutter'). Du kan bare rekruttere soldater når du er i festningen din, så det er viktig at du ikke beveger deg ut for tidlig."
tut5="Ok, jeg tror jeg er klar. La oss begynne!"
tut6="Jeg rekrutterer selvfølgelig mine egne soldater for å kjempe mot dine."
tut7="Ok. Hvordan får jeg tak i flere gullstykker slik at jeg kan rekruttere flere soldater?"
tut8="Hvis du flytter en av dine soldater inn i en landsby, tar du kontroll over den. Hver landsby du kontrollerer vil gi deg to gullstykker hver runde. Hver av soldatene dine koster deg ett gullstykke hver runde."

	msg3_23="You must lead our men to the city, and try to help defend it - or recapture it if it falls before you arrive."
	msg3_24="I must do that? But what about you Delfador? You're coming with me right?"

	msg3_3="Very well. Be careful!"
	msg3_30="Farewell, prince."
	msg3_4="But boss, why are we only using bats and nagas?"

	msg3_8="Hahaha! Now orcs will rule over land and sea!"

	msg5_2="My lord! It seems the city has already fallen!"
	msg5_20="Delfador, we have captured this city, but surely Asheviere's men will come and attack us! What should we do?"
	msg5_21="The Council has met, and we have decided: we must capture the Sceptre of Fire"
	msg5_22="The Sceptre of Fire? What's that?"
	msg5_23="During the reign of Garard I, your uncle's father, the dwarves of Knalga agreed to make the king a magnificent scepter. It took their finest smiths years to make it. But soon after it was completed, Orcs invaded the tunnels of Knalga. Now Knalga is in chaos, and though some Dwarves still live in parts of it, always at war with the Orcs, the sceptre was lost somewhere in the great caverns."
	msg5_24="Oh, but what has this to do with me?"
	msg5_25="Garard II, your uncle, was deciding upon a successor. He issued an edict that whichever member of the royal family could retrieve the Sceptre of Fire would rule the land."
	msg5_26="Oh, and you want me to get this sceptre?"
	msg5_26a="We will help you get it, my lord."
	msg5_27="Time is short. We think that Asheviere is also searching for the Sceptre, to help seal her place as ruler. If you get the Sceptre first though, the people will support you as the king."
	msg5_28="Me? The king?"
	msg5_29="Yes Konrad. I believe you will be king one day. Now let us make haste!"
	msg5_3="This is terrible news! We must retake the city!"
	msg5_4="There are so many of them. This will not be easy! And look to the south, it seems that the undead are allied with the Orcs!"
	msg5_5="Here come the Elves! With our newly forged alliance with the Orcs, we will crush them with ease!"
	msg5_6="We must take the city, and destroy the evil undead before reinforcements arrive!"
	msg5_7="In the night, three dark figures crept out of the forest"
	msg5_8="Halt! Who goes there? Friend or foe?"

	msg6_1="On the road to Knalga, the party was opposed by the forces of Asheviere"
	msg6_10="Halt! You shall not pass!"

	msg6_25="Ogres! I need more ogres to defeat them!"
	msg6_26="Surely an ogre will crush them!"
	msg6_27="I surrender! Don't hurt me, imposter."
	msg6_28="I said before I'm not an imposter, but if you yield, I will spare your life."
	msg6_29="Let me go!"
	msg6_3="That's the princess, Li'sar. The Queen adopted her, and rumour has it that she is raising her to be her successor!"
	msg6_30="Think about the story of the old king, ask somebody old about it."
	msg6_31="The old king? I have heard about that, but I know it's not true. My mother told me."
	msg6_32="Your mother has lied to you, child. Now I suggest you reconsider, and either join us, or flee into exile. There will be a great battle soon, and if you are on the wrong side of it, we may not have the opportunity to spare your life a second time."
	msg6_33="I'm not a child, and I don't want to talk about it! Now you said you would spare me, so be on your way. The northern road should be safe for you."
	msg6_34="Good day, princess. Come men, to the northern road!"
	msg6_35="(hehe, little do they know just how many undead have wandered the northern road of late. Surely they are doomed!)"

	msg6_5="It's no use reasoning. There is only one thing she will understand. To arms!"
	msg6_6="This is taking too much time, I best call some reinforcements!"
	msg6_7="Maybe I wasn't using enough forces..."

	msg6_9="Stop!!!"
	msg7_1="My lord! This road does not seem as safe as we had hoped, look around us at the hills, there are undead about!"
	msg7_10="Whew! They seem to be retreating at last!"
	msg7_11="Yes! We have fought them off"
	msg7_12="Now, why did you lie to us and tell us this way was safe, and why did you now save us, young lady?"
	msg7_13="Well, I uhh...well I wanted you to all die after you defeated me, but then I felt guilty about it, and decided I better help you!"
	msg7_14="And where are all your men?"
	msg7_15="Well I left them! I snuck away with a few of my most loyal men. I've decided I don't want to succeed my mother. She would have happily let you all die, but I realized that I just couldn't do that."
	msg7_16="So are you going to join us now?"
	msg7_17="Ohhh, may I, sir?"
	msg7_18="Yes you may, child."
	msg7_19="I can see that our work is done here. We must return to our pilgrimage!"

	msg7_9="We also have come to help. When the princess told us of your great need against the undead, we offered our services."
	msg8_1="That is the famous Gryphon Mountain! Maybe if we could capture some gryphon pups or get some of their eggs we could train them as mounts!"
	msg8_2="My lord Konrad, we have to be very carefull, disturbing the monsters in their nest could be very dangerous."
	msg8_3="Nice idea, Konrad! I love flying mounts!"
	msg8_4="Well, everybody, let start climbing that mountain."
	msg8_5="Fools, we could ambush them while they're fighting the monsters."
	msg8_6="We have defeated them! Now what do we do?"
	msg8_7="We must continue north. It is too late to return to the safety of Elensefar or Anduin before winter befalls us. Thus we must cross the great river and continue toward the land of the Dwarves. Come let us go!"
	msg8_8="With these gryphon eggs we should be able to breed gryphons that will serve us. That will let us hire gryphon riders!"
	msg8_9="Onward men!"
	msg9_1="This is the Ford of Abez. When we ford this river, we will be leaving Wesnoth, and entering the lands of the North. The lands the Dwarves once ruled, but which are now filled only with chaos. This is where your father and uncle were betrayed to their deaths, almost nineteen years ago now, Konrad."
	msg9_10="That foolish boy killed himself."
	msg9_11="What do you mean, Delfador?"
	msg9_12="I mustered men to fight against the traitor-king, and of course Asheviere, the one behind it all. We were out numbered, perhaps four-to-one. In the heat of battle, that boy, that foolish boy, came charging at me, slashing wildly. I had little choice but to end him."
	msg9_13="So it is true, that you did kill him?"
	msg9_14="He did die in battle, at my hand. It is sad that Konrad's four brothers did not have the opportunity to experience such an 'honorable' death."
	msg9_15="Oh, what happened to them?"
	msg9_16="With all respect my lords, we must make haste. We have to ford the river as a matter of urgency. Look! It seems that the guard towers on the river banks are guarded!"
	msg9_17="Look! Some of the southerners, the men of Wesnoth are trying to cross into our lands! We will have to stop them men!"
	msg9_18="Isn't there somewhere else we can cross? Maybe upstream?"
	msg9_19="Winter bears down on us fast. We have only a few days to make the crossing, and the nearest bridge is far upstream. To be trapped south of the river when winter arrives would be suicidal, Asheviere would have us like rats! Look to the west! Asheviere has a border fort here, and it seems to be full of soldiers! We must cross here, and quickly!"
	msg9_19a="Who are those who try to cross the river? After them men! Don't let them cross!"
	msg9_2="Really? So what happened, Delfador?"
	msg9_20="Come, let us go!"
	msg9_3="The forces of the king were encamped here. The forces of the north were camped on the north side of the river. For three days and three nights the armies faced each other, neither one willing to ford the river. On the fourth day, the northern armies crossed the river, and attacked us."
	msg9_4="Oh, what happened then? Who won?"
	msg9_5="We were winning the battle. We were repelling them."
	msg9_6="Until the king's son, in the heat of battle, until he turned on the king!"
	msg9_7="Oh, and then you....you killed the prince, right Delfador?"
	msg9_8="When I saw the king betrayed and his banner fall, I fled the battle. Be it wisdom or be it cowardice, I fled the battle, seeing us have no hope that day."
	msg9_9="But my mother...the Queen, she always told me that you killed my brother, Sir"
	msg9_a1="Ruaarrrrrrrr!"
	msg9_a2="What is that?"
	msg9_a3="Creatures of the deep are upon us! This may be very dangerous. Quick, we must get to the other side as fast as we can!"
	msg9_a4="We have made it across the river safely! Where to now?"
	msg9_a5="We must continue north. We must seek help with the northern Dwarves if we are to stand a hope of penetrating into Knalga."
	msg=10_10="If this is true, Konrad, perhaps we should take another route and go around the mountain, rather then to try and defeat these new foes."

# introduction

	intro_1="Im einundzwanzigstem Jahr Garard des Zweiten, König von Wesnoth, wurde das Königreich in einen erbitterten Krieg mit den Nordländern gezogen."
	intro_2="Die Nordländer liessen sich in der Nähe von Galcadar bei der Furt von Abez nieder und der König führte seine Streitkräfte an, um ihnen zu begegnen. Er teilte sein Heer, führte die eine Hälfte und ließ seinen Sohn Kronprinz Eldred die andere Hälfte führen."
	intro_3="Eldred war ein furchtloser und mutiger Krieger, der seine Soldaten zu führen verstand. Zu Garads Unglück war er außerdem ehrgeizig.....und tückisch. In der Hitze des Gefechts wandten sich die Männer von Eldred gegen ihren König. Garard wurde an diesem Tag im Kampf erschlagen, genauso wie sein Bruder und alle seine Söhne bis auf Eldred."
	intro_4="Garards Königin, Asheviere, die gekommen war, um die Schlacht von einem nahen Hügel zu beobachten, sah dies mit Freude. Sicherlich würde ihr Sohn in einer Weise herrschen die ihre Gier nach Macht besser befriedigen würde, als es ihr Ehemann getan hatte."
	intro_5="Der König der Nordländer schloss gegen Tribut erfreut Frieden mit Eldred. Eldred rief sich zum König aus und führte sein Heer zurück nach Weldyn."
	intro_6="Aber Garads Erzmagier, Delfador, entkam in der Schlacht und kam nach einem Eilritt zuerst in Weldyn an. Er heuerte eine Schar Königstreuer an um Eldred zu bekämpfen und den Tod des Königs zu rächen."
	intro_7="Eldred begann den Kampf mit der klaren Weisung seiner Mutter im Sinn: Kämpfe gegen niemanden groß oder klein, außer dem alten Magier, dessen Kopf von seiner Schulter getrennt werden soll."
	intro_8="Eldred traf tatsächlich in dieser Schlacht im Zweikampf auf Delfador. Schwert krachte gegen Stab. Der weise Magier gegen den jungen, starken und furchtlosen Krieger."
	intro_9="Delfadors Männer verloren die Schlacht und wurden in alle Winde verstreut, aber Asheviere fand den Körper ihres Sohnes von Delfadors Stab zu Boden gestreckt."
	intro_10="Asheviere übernahm das Kommando über die Armee und führte sie zurück nach Weldyn. Als ihr klar wurde, das die Neffen des Königs die nächsten in der Thronfolge waren, befahl sie, sie alle zu töten und krönte sich selber zur Königin Mutter von Wesnoth."
	intro_11="Als er von Ashevieres Befehl hörte, schlich sich Delfador in den Palast und entführte Konrad, den jüngsten von Garards Neffen, um ihn vor dem Tod zu bewahren."
	intro_12="Delfador versteckte das Kind in den Wäldern im Westen und ließ ihn unter dem Schutz der Elfen aufwachsen. Traurig sah Delfador Ashevieres Gewaltherrschaft über das Land beginnen..."

	tut2="Willkommen auf dem Übungsgelände, Konrad. Zeige dein Können indem du mich in einem Scheingefecht besiegst."
	tut3="Ohh...na gut, wie fange ich an ?"
	tut4="Du hast zweihundert Goldstücke um Soldaten damit anzuheuern. Das erste was du tun solltest, rekrutiere ein paar Soldaten (Rechts-Klick und "Rekrutieren" auswählen). Du kannst nur Soldaten rekrutieren, wenn du in deiner Burg bist, es ist also wichtig, diese nicht zu früh zu verlassen."
	tut5="Gut, ich glaube ich bin bereit. Laß uns anfangen !"
	tut6="Selbstverständlich heuere ich auch Soldaten an, um deine zu bekämpfen."
	tut7="Gut. Wie komme ich jetzt an mehr Gold, um noch mehr Soldaten anzuheuern ?"
	tut8="Wenn du einen deiner Soldaten in ein Dorf bewegst, wird es von dir kontrolliert. Jedes Dorf, daß du kontrollierst, liefert dir pro Runde zwei Goldstücke. Jeder deiner Soldaten kostet dich pro Runde ein Goldstück."
	tut9="Also ist es wichtig für mich viele Dörfer zu kontrollieren, so daß ich viel Gold bekomme, um viele Soldaten anzuheuern ?"
	tut10="Ganz genau ! Es ist außerdem wichtig, mich daran zu hindern, weitere Dörfer zu kontrollieren und Dörfer, die ich kontrolliere, zurückzuerobern, damit ich so wenig Gold wie möglich bekomme."
	tut11="Auf Männer, laßt uns ein paar Dörfer erobern !"
	tut12="Woher weiß ich, welche Art von Soldaten ich brauche, Delfador?"
	tut13="Du mußt sorgfältig ihre Fähigkeiten studieren. Am Anfang brauchst du schnelle Einheiten, um schnell so viele Dörfer wie möglich zu bekommen. Danach sollte der Großteil deiner Armee wahrscheinlich aus Kämpfern bestehen. Bedenke, daß alle elfischen Einheiten sehr gut im Wald kämpfen. Reiter sind hervorragend im offenen Gelände. Magier sind gut zur Unterstützung und können wie Bogenschützen eingesetzt werden. Wenn deine Magier erfahrener werden, sind sie besonders mächtig."
	tut14="Wenn du beschließt, eine feindliche Einheit anzugreifen, kannst du auswählen, welche Waffe benutzt werden soll. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit für einen Treffer und der Schaden, den ein Treffer anrichtet, werden angezeigt."
	tut15="Ein guter Versuch, Konrad, aber es sieht so aus, als ob du noch viel lernen mußt."

	Mage_description="Der Magier ist schwach aber auch mächtig. Er bewegt sich langsam, ist schwach in der Defensive und greift mit magischen Geschossen an, die immer mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit ihr Ziel treffen. Aus diesem Grund ist der Magier eine gute Wahl um Feinde in unwegsamen Gelände auszuheben."

	OrcishArcher="Ork-Bogenschütze"
	OrcishArcher_description="Der Bogenschütze wird von vielen Orks als niedrige Kaste der Krieger angesehen, weil er seine Gegner aus der Distanz angreift. Jedenfalls, da die meisten Orks nicht in der Lage sind, einen Bogen zu benutzen, sind sie ein wertvoller Bestandteil der Orkheere."

	OrcishAssassin="Ork-Meuchler"
	OrcishAssassin_description="Obwohl er im Kampf nicht so stark ist, ist der Ork-Meuchler schnell, kann sich selbst in unterschiedlicher Umgebung gut verteidigen und vergiftet seine Wurfpfeile. Ein von diesem Gift getroffene Einheit nimmt ständig Schaden, bis sie auf einem Dorf anhält, um geheilt zu werden."

	OrcishCrossbow="Ork-Armbrustschütze"
	OrcishCrossbow_description="Der Armbrustschütze macht seine Schwäche mit der rohen Gewalt seiner Waffe wett. Obwohl im Kampf auf Distanz nicht so effektiv wie ein Elfenscharfschütze, ist er robuster und beherrscht den Nahkampf besser."

	OrcishGrunt="Ork-Grunzer"
	OrcishGrunt_description="Der Grunzer macht einen Großteil der Orkstreitkräfte aus. Obwohl langsamer als Menschen oder Elfen ist der Grunzer in der Lage sehr viel stärker auszuteilen und wesentlich mehr einzustecken, bevor er fällt."

	OrcishSlayer="Ork-Schlächter"
	OrcishSlayer_description="Schnell und beweglich, erfahren im Nahkampf und auf Distanz ist der Ork-Schlächter mit seiner vergifteten Attacke ein ernstzunehmender Gegner."

	OrcishWarlord="Ork-Kriegsherr"
	OrcishWarlord_description="Nur Orks mit großer Gerissenheit und unvergleichlicher Stärke können Kriegsherren werden. Gewandt mit Schwert und Bogen, führen diese Kriegerbestien die Kampfverbände der Orks an."

	OrcishWarrior="Orkkrieger"
	OrcishWarrior_description="Der Orkkrieger beherrscht die Kunst mit zwei Schwertern zu kämpfen und wird deshalb von allen Orks respektiert und von seinen Feinden gefürchtet. Sein einzige Schwäche ist seine Unfähigkeit, den Bogen zu benutzen."

	Troll="Troll"
	Troll_description="Trolle sind starke und brutale menschenähnliche Monster, die die verblüffende Fähigkeit haben, sich zu regenerieren, sich also mitten im Kampf von ihren Wunden zu erholen."

	WolfRider="Wolfreiter"
	WolfRider_description="Obwohl kleiner und schwächer als die Orks, trainieren die Kobolde große Wölfe um sie zu reiten und als schnelle Kundschafter der Koboldarmee zu verwenden. Dadurch, daß sie in den dunklen Höhlen der Orks aufgezogen wurden, trotzen die Wölfe und ihre Reiter auch den Bergen, was sie von anderen berittenen Einheiten unterscheidet."

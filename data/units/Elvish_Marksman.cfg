	unit_description= _ "One of the things which contributes to their skill with the bow is the unusually clear vision of elves. An elf practiced at archery can hit targets that a man couldn't even see, even at night, and can nock a second arrow almost as soon as the first is let fly.

This prodigious skill does come with one cost, that being a lack of practice with the sword.

Special Notes: Their marksmanship gives these elves a high chance of hitting their enemy, but only on the attack."

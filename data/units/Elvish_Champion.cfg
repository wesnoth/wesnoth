unit_description= _ "Those few elves who deliberately hone themselves into weapons of war become something which belies the rather docile reputation of their race. Dedication and skill are matched with purity of form, and the result is a mastery of swordsmanship to which few can compare. Even archery, treated as a secondary pursuit, is executed with a skill that most of humanity can only stare at with wonder."

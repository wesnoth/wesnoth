unit_description= _ "The many paths that a mage can take in study lead to strikingly different ends. Silver magi have devoted themselves to a study of the forces that bind reality together, and have managed, somewhat, to unravel the mysteries of a world far more vast than most would ever imagine. Often viewed as sages, or wandering mystics, silver magi act under an agenda which is obscure even to their own colleagues. Though helpful to the magisteriums which often employ them in the field, they remain somewhat aloof.

They have, in fact, their own order amongst the ranks of magi, an order which withholds certain secrets from their peers. One of these is an apparent ability to cross great distances, faster than one could possibly travel on foot. Members of the silver order ardently refuse to discuss the workings of this with any of their fellow magi, and on those rare occasions when others have pried into their work, they have abandoned the endeavor, never to speak of it again.

Silver magi are often more physically adept than other magi, and their skills are of undeniable use on the battlefield, if one can manage to coerce the mage into applying them.

Special Notes: the ranged attack of a silver mage is magical, and always has a high chance of hitting an opponent. Silver Magi are highly resistant to many forms of magical damage. They can also teleport between any two villages instantly, though the player must control both, and the destination village must be unoccupied."

unit_description= _ "Trolls typically neither need nor prefer to use any proper armament in combat, as large 'sticks and stones' serve them all too well. However, trolls have been seen on numerous occasions clad in rough-shod armor and bearing metal hammers. It is speculated that their typical orcish allies are the source and often crafters of these, as expeditions into several forcibly-vacated troll holes have shown little evidence of tool use, and certainly no metalworking of any kind. Given how dangerous a troll is in combat, the thought of a troll in full armor is entirely unsettling.

Special Notes: Trolls possess the regeneration ability, which heals them as though they were always stationed in a village."

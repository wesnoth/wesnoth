unit_description= _ "Some magi, as they learn about the world around them, and learn the truth of the suffering and squalor in which humanity too often lives, find that they cannot bring themselves to be cloistered into a life of study. These men and women give up the life of a mage, and join monastic orders, dedicating the skills they have been given to the good of all. After their ordination, they often travel the world, ministering to sickness and injury.

Though not trained for combat, there is one enemy against which they are a potent ally. If need arises, they can call on the power of the Light to banish the unworldly from the mortal plane.

Special Notes: the light cast by a white mage is magical in nature, and always has a high chance of hitting an opponent. This light does tremendous damage to the undead, and can even damage living creatures. White magi are capable of healing units around them, and curing them of poison."

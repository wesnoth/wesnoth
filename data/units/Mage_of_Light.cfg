unit_description="Mages of Light are awesome allies of all lawful combatants, and fearsome foes to the forces of chaos. These Mages' powers of illumination are so great that the hexes they occupy and all adjacent hexes never experience night. As a result, when a unit is adjacent to a Mage of Light, it will fight as if it were day when it is dusk, and as if it were dusk when it is night. Like the White Mages, the Mages of Light also cure adjacent friendly units."

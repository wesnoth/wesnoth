unit_description= _ "A Drake Clasher is incapable of both flight and fire-breathing, and most assume their relegation to melee combat is because of disability - an attempt to garner use from what otherwise would be a liability. It is possible that they have some mild deficiency in those skills, but those who support this theory have failed to consider how uniquely well-suited they are to combat a fellow drake.

They are, in fact, the Judicators of the Drake Hierarchy, and though their armament is now largely ceremonial, it is none the less effective. In their encounters with lesser races, they discovered that their natural size and strength were themselves powerful weapons, and when combined with the armament worn by this caste, the resulting warriors lack some of the typical weaknesses of their kind, such as the strong vulnerability to spears and arrows."

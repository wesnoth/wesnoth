	unit_description= _ "For as long as anyone can remember, the members of the various 'guilds' of rat-catchers that spring up in any larger city have had a curious practice of bleaching their hair with lime till it becomes a pale shade of blue. It is a bold thing to do, as their profession often delves into less-than-legal enterprises. Thieves have many skills, and by necessity are both light on their feet, and good with knives. They happily employ less-than-honorable tactics in combat, seeing little purpose in a 'fair fight'.

Special Notes: while a unit with the same allegiance as the thief distracts an enemy, the thief may backstab, inflicting double damage, by creeping around behind that enemy."

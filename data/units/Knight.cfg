Knights, therefore, carry swords in their armament, and practice tactics which, although requiring of much more patience, are far safer than a charge. Their lances are still at the ready, however, and growing experience with these weapons is only to their benefit." + _ "

Special Notes: the Knight's charging lance attack doubles both damage dealt and received. This does not affect his defensive retaliation."

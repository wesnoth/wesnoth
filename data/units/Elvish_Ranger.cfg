	unit_description= _ "Though a man might spend years in the forest, he will never shake the feeling that he is a guest in a place he is not truly a part of. With elves, this is quite reversed. Any elf that studies the lore of the woods becomes a fitting master of them, and when combined with a considerable skill at archery and swordsmanship, the result is a powerful tool of war.

Special Notes: the rangers' skill as woodsmen render them invisible to an enemy unless they are immediately adjacent, or have revealed themselves by attacking."

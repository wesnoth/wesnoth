unit_description="The final form that mages of the undead can achieve, Ancient Liches strike terror into the hearts of those who see them. Not only is their touch that of death, but their spells are powerful enough to freeze even the bravest where they stand. Should you ever come across one of these, flee fast and far, for they move faster than most undead."

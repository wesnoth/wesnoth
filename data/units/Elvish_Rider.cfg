unit_description= _ "The master horsemen of the elves are able to move through forests at a speed which would be suicidal to any man. Though this certainly leaves people in awe of the rider, questions have also been raised about the stock of the horses, for the feats they perform seem almost supernatural.

This combination of incredible mobility and potent combat strength is one of the greatest assets the elves possess in warfare."

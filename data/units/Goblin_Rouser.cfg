unit_description= _ "Standard Bearers are an oddity amongst Goblins. Firstly they have survived a war, but perhaps more significantly, they were remembered to have survived one by other Goblins. His oft maddened rabble on the battlefield nonetheless seems to effectively steel the younger at arms.

Special Notes: the leadership of a Goblin Rouser enables friendly units next to it to deal more damage in combat, though this only applies to units of lower level."

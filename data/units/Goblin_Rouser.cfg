unit_description= _ "Standard bearers are an oddity amongst goblins. A goblin who has survived enough battles to be considered a veteran is rare enough, and it is rarer still for the other goblins to recognize and respect his veteran status. Nonetheless, a rouser's frenzied goading effectively steels the younger at arms to fight harder and longer before they die.

Special Notes: the leadership of a Goblin Rouser enables friendly units next to it to deal more damage in combat, though this only applies to units of lower level."

unit_description= _ "Drake gliders wear as little armour as possible so they can quickly escape their foes when they leave their caves. These Drakes are compotent fighters, possesing the internal fire common to many of their kin. Gliders can also effectively use their speed to viciously slam their opponents into submission. The best gliders can look forward to being accepted into the ranks of the high flying Sky Drakes."

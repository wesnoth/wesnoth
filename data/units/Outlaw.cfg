Having proven themselves in combat, they are given more dangerous tasks, and a greater share of the spoils. Though many opponents would mock their choice of weaponry, the outlaws are well aware of its deadly capacity, and also of the ready availability of ammunition. Outlaws are somewhat ill at ease fighting during the day, preferring the cover of nightfall."

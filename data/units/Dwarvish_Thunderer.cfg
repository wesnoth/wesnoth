unit_description= _ "When the men of Wesnoth first encountered the dwarves, they were mystified by the power of the Dwarvish Thunderers, who were able to hurl death from afar through the apparatus of these strange ... 'wands' they carried into battle. After the peace instituted by the Ka'lian came into effect, Haldric's people, not understanding these weapons, and certainly unable to make any of their own, realized they were lucky to no longer be fighting the dwarves, and vowed never to do so again."

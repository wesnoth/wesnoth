Magi have spent several years in study, and have amassed a sum of knowledge which sets them apart. In a world where few people can read and write, these men and women have committed themselves fully to the pursuit of knowledge. Their ranks are filled with the children of hopeful nobility, or those who sought an escape from the intellectual void begotten by a life of manual labor.

It is an irony that, with all the knowledge they have amassed and their unassuming monopoly of it, the collective community of magi could likely rule society, were they ever to try. However, their true love is neither money, nor power, and those who see the study of magic as a means to such ends often lack the very conviction that is required for true mastery.

Physically frail, and lacking familiarity with combat, magi do possess certain arts which are of great utility in battle.

Special Notes: the ranged attack of a mage is magical, and always has a high chance of hitting an opponent."

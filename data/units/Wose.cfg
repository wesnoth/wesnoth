unit_description= _ "Woses are treelike creatures of legend. They rose from the forest, and when in a forest they are indistinguishable from ordinary trees. Their form is very slow and stiff, so they cannot avoid attacks very well. Their tough bark is highly resistant to cold, crushing attacks, and arrows, although blades have no trouble cutting through it, and they are very flammable. By drawing nutrients from the ground and energy from the sun, Woses can regrow missing limbs after a fight."

unit_description= _ "Being partly faerie in nature, elves have an inherent capability for magic. This is realized in their affinity with the natural world, which they can call upon as an ally in combat. Enemies wandering in their forests may soon find themselves entangled by the very roots they stand on, making them much less of a threat.

The healing abilities of the elves are also remarkable, and of capital use in battle.

Special Notes: A shaman's entangling attack slows enemies down and reduces by one the strikes they can deliver in combat. Shamans are capable of basic healing, though they can only delay the effects of poison, not cure them entirely."

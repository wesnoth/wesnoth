unit_description="Trained from childhood to ride, and to follow a strict code of honor, Horsemen are both fast and powerful at attacking. Charging at their enemies, their attacks do double damage, but also cause the horsemen to receive double damage when struck. Rebels against Asheviere's tyranny often use horsemen against her."

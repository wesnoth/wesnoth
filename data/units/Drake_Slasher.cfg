unit_description= _ "With their stumpy vestigial wings and inability to use their great internal fire as a weapon some may think that these Drakes are disadvantaged, they would be mistaken. To compensate they have become great craftsmen that can fabricate weapons with emerald edges, and wear heavy armour. The Slashers' weapon of choice is the halberd, which they use to great effect."

	unit_description= _ "Lancers are some of the bravest and most feared riders in all of Wesnoth. Clad in minimal armor, they free themselves to ride swiftly, faster than any of their peers. The daring tactics they employ are a double-edged sword, often winning either glory, or a swift death. Lancers excel in hunting down infantrymen who've made the mistake of breaking formation, and in piercing defensive lines. However, they have limited use in defense." + _ "

Special Notes: the Lancer's charging lance attack doubles both damage dealt and received. This does not affect his defensive retaliation."

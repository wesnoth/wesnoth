unit_description="A noble by birth, the Outlaw Queen has learnt swordplay with the greatest generals and battle tactics with the greatest sages, making her both a great combatant and leader. However, she is the product of a failed aristocracy who has opted for the life of an Outlaw. She dreams of founding her own Queendom with the plunder she finds on the road, and she is ever so close to that goal."

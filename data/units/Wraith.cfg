unit_description="The most powerful ghosts in the undead ranks can use their powers to summon a spectral sword that drains the life out of their foes, strengthening themselves. They can also shout a terrible wail that freezes the heart of the weak. Those slain by the wail come back as wraiths to serve their killer."

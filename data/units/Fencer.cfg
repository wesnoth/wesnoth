unit_description= _ "Fencers belong to a school of thought that considers the armor most soldiers wear in combat to be their own worst enemy. While armor can only soften a blow, evading it will completely negate any ill effects. Being able to reliably dodge any offensive move is a luxury only afforded to the fit of body, and then only to those who endure rigorous training.

Outfitted with only a dagger and rapier, fencers are light on their feet and useful in many situations where their armor-bound peers are at a disadvantage. They relish, often literally, in dancing circles around troops like heavy infantry, in mockery of the price they pay for their full plate.

Special Notes: their skill at skirmishing allows fencers to dart right past an opponent, ignoring zones of control."

unit_description="Fencers are trained in the arts of swordplay. While their rapier is a light weapon, they can use it quickly and with deadly skill. Wielding a dagger in their other hand, they can also deftly parry all kinds of attacks. Fencers are skirmishers, and so can move right past enemy units."

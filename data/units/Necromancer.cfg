	unit_description= _ "One of the greatest circles of what is considered 'black magic' is the art of necromancy, the terrible ability to awaken the dead with false life. This ability, in all aspects, was the first step towards cheating death of its ultimate prize; though not the fulfillment of what they had hoped for, it was a discovery that nonetheless had terrible ramifications. This art alone may have caused humanity's condemnation of what is now known as 'black magic', and has given fear a vast new arsenal.

Special Notes: The ranged attacks of a necromancer are magical, and always have a high chance of hitting an opponent."

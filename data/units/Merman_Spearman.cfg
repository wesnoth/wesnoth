	unit_description= _ "Archery is little favored by the mermen, for whom javelinry serves the same function. Though thrown javelins are of little use under the water, they are extremely useful at the surface, where their weight allows them to plunge several feet below the water while retaining enough momentum to remain effective. They are also useful in melee, even deep under the surface, which is something that certainly cannot be said of arrows."

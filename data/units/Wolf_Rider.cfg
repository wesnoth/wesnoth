unit_description= _ "No one is quite sure how the practice of taming and riding wolves came into being. Goblins are smaller and much weaker than orcs. Any who can manage to win themselves a mount have a much safer, and daresay, more amusing role in combat.

Wolves, likely, could never support the weight of a man in plate, but a goblin in leather armor is a simple load to bear. Quite unlike horses, these mounts have a rather easy time traversing the mountains, though water and woods will still slow them down."

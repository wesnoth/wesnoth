	unit_description= _ "It is a peculiar fashion of Wesnoth's nobility, in that they typically enroll their sons into one of two orders of armigers, training them either in the art of horsemanship, or fencing. Duelists are so named for an unfortunately common practice of young aristocrats, for whom the heat of insult can sometimes incite a rash demonstration of their natural right.

Experienced fencers, who often look the part of nobility if not always actually of noble birth, carry with them a small crossbow that is easily concealed under a coat or cape. Slow to load and often thought dishonorable to use, it is in fact very useful, and those of their ranks who live long enough to be veterans typically do so by making such concessions to utility and survival.

Special Notes: their skill at skirmishing allows these fencers to dart right past an opponent, ignoring zones of control."

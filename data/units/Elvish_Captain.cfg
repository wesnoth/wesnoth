unit_description= _ "Elves, unlike many other races, will quickly acknowledge and follow any of their peers who have experience in combat. This is quite at odds with humanity, for whom leadership is often a fickle mess of coercion and intimidation. The combination of their willingness to accept the wisdom of their leaders, and the tendency to choose leaders of merit is one of the quiet strengths of the elves.

Special Notes: the leadership of a Captain enables friendly units next to it to deal more damage in combat, though this only applies to units of lower level."

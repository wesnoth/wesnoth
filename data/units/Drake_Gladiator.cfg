unit_description= _ "The Gladiator has taken a completely different path than from Slashers. Rather than emphasize training, they have chosen to focus on the craft of their weaponry. They are the smiths of Drake Society, and it follows they they possess the best weaponry - the sharpest blades and spears, and the maces which complement their already impressive array. Their intense focus on their weapons comes at the slight expense of their defensive abilities."

unit_description= _ "Mermaids, like elves, have a powerful and native ability in magic, though theirs is considerably different. Those who master this ability are held in high regard, and their skill is used in a multitude of crafts, many of which are things that humanity would never dream of. The obvious use in war is forbidden against their own race - this power is the greater part of what protects their people from the monsters that wander out of the abyss.

Special Notes: The blasts of water conjured by mermaids are magical in nature, and always have a high chance of hitting their opponents."

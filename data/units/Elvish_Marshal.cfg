	unit_description= _ "The longevity and natural intelligence of elves makes for a vicious aptitude for military matters, enough even to counter their general distaste for such things. Elves remember things much more clearly than humankind, and can often intuit what others can only be trained to do. Certainly, on those rare occasions when an elf sets his mind to war, the strategy that results is the work of a master.

Special Notes: the leadership of a Marshal enables friendly units next to it to deal more damage in combat, though this only applies to units of lower level"

#note for posterity's sake - the previous animation was the bow frame from -400 to -300, then attack3 from -300 to 0, and the bow frame again from 0 to 100. Cheap, but it got the job done, and others might want the timing for reference.

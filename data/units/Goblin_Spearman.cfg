unit_description= _ "In any litter of orcs, several are born much smaller and weaker than the rest. These runts are called 'Goblins,' and are looked down on by the rest of their kin. In battle, these are given the most meagre of equipment, and are used as a shield to give the Warlords time to prepare the real assault.

Some speculate that these existence of these creatures is the beginning of a failure of the orcish bloodline, though no one knows enough of their history to state anything conclusive."

unit_description= _ "Thugs come from a wide variety of sources; while a few are born into thuggery, many are former soldiers deemed unfit to serve in the army or peasants thrown off their lands. They quickly become thugs as a means of sustenance. Regardless of their background, they all share a similar characteristic: they beat victims with large clubs."

	unit_description= _ "Shock troopers are the elite of the heavy infantry, and half of their use in war is simply a matter of intimidation. The only men who can enter their ranks are prodigiously well-built, and when clad in black plate brimming with spikes, they are a fearsome sight to behold. The sight of Shock Troopers breaking an enemy with their morning stars is often enough to shatter the morale of any opposition, who sometimes wonder if such armor covers monsters, rather than men. The drawback of such heavy armor is, of course, the time it takes to move into and out of combat."

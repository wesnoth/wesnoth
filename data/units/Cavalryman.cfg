unit_description= _ "Cavalrymen are distinguished from horsemen by their tactics and equipment. A cavalryman wears heavier armor, and carries a sword and shield, rather than a lance. Their tactics do not include charging, but instead maneuvers like hit and run slashes with their sword, using both horse and rider as an effective tool of melee.

Cavalrymen are very useful for taking and holding positions on open ground, for screening friendly soldiers, and also for scoutwork."

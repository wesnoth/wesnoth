	unit_description= _ "Though some consider it cowardly to use, poison is a weapon favored by orcs, especially those weak of frame. Orcish assassins, who use it on throwing knives, are typically a bit frail, although surprisingly nimble. Though rarely the ones who deal the killing blow, their tactics are a considerable aid to their larger and more brutal kin.

Special Notes: Orcish Assassins use poison on their throwing knives, and victims of this poison will continually take damage until they can be cured in town or by a healer."

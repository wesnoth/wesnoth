# README

The programs in this directory data/tools/wesnoth
are for checking, analysing and maintenance of WML-files.

The modules intended to be imported by other programs are
documented in the parent directory's README.md. These are
wmltools3.py, wmldata.py, wmlparser.py, wmlparser3.py, and
wmliterator3.py.

`__init__.py`
  Cause Python to execute any code in this directory on "import wesnoth".

`campaignserver_client.py`
  textmode-client for uploading + downloding campaigns to the server.

`wescamp.py`
  This utility provides two tools
  * sync a campaign with the version on wescamp (using the packed campaign 
    as base)
  * update the translations in a campaign (in the packed campaign)

    <hajo> I just don't see the big picture about the files in that directory - who needs it for what task ?
    
    <Sapient> well, let's say you want to process some WML files and transform them or understand them in a program
    <Sapient> if you want to perform lexical analysis, then using wmliterator would save you a lot of work
    <Sapient> if you want to parse it and get the overall tree, then wmlparser would be the choice
    
    <hajo> Ok, but campaign / scenario-authors rarely do that
    <Sapient> right...
    
    <Sapient> if you want to write tools to help you author those campaigns, 
    <Sapient> you might write some programs or to maintain them
    <Sapient> so it is only useful if you are a programmer
    
    <Sapient> although wmliterator can do a decent job of detecting unbalanced WML 
    <Sapient> if that's all you need to do just run it from the command line for that
    <Sapient> so it would let you know that [a][/b][/a] is invalid, and give you a line number
    <Sapient> or [a][b][/a]
    
    <hajo> it just says "reading x.cfg" and "y lines read"
    <Sapient> right, no errors
    <Sapient> it iterated successfully

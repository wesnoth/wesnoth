# @file README

The programs in this directory data/tools/wesnoth
are for checking, analysing and maintenance of WML-files,
written in python.

###

\_\_init\_\_.py
  Cause Python to execute any code in this directory on "import wesnoth".

campaignserver_client.py
  textmode-client for uploading + downloding campaigns to the server.

wescamp.py
  This utility provides two tools
  * sync a campaign with the version on wescamp (using the packed campaign 
    as base)
  * update the translations in a campaign (in the packed campaign)

wmldata.py
  This module represents the internal appearance of WML.

wmliterator.py
  Python routines for navigating a Battle For Wesnoth WML tree

wmlparser.py
  Module implementing a WML parser.

wmltools.py
  Python routines for working with a Battle For Wesnoth WML tree

\<hajo> I just don't see the big picture about the files in that directory - who needs it for what task ?

\<Sapient> well, let's say you want to process some WML files and transform them or understand them in a program  
\<Sapient> if you want to perform lexical analysis, then using wmliterator would save you a lot of work  
\<Sapient> if you want to parse it and get the overall tree, then wmlparser would be the choice

\<hajo> Ok, but campaign / scenario-authors rarely do that

\<Sapient> right...  
\<Sapient> if you want to write tools to help you author those campaigns,  
\<Sapient> you might write some programs or to maintain them  
\<Sapient> so it is only useful if you are a programmer  
\<Sapient> although wmliterator can do a decent job of detecting unbalanced WML  
\<Sapient> if that's all you need to do just run it from the command line for that  
\<Sapient> so it would let you know that \[a]\[/b]\[/a] is invalid, and give you a line number
\<Sapient> or \[a]\[b]\[/a]

\<hajo> it just says "reading x.cfg" and "y lines read"

\<Sapient> right, no errors  
\<Sapient> it iterated successfully

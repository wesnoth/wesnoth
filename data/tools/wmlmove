wmlmove -- generate commands to move a unit in the Wesnoth tree

usage: wmlmove --help
       wmlmove [--revert] {src...} {dst}

This script facilitates moving units (referenced by their .cfg file) 
along with all of their associated resources (images and sounds).
It may be run from the Wesnoth top-level directory or anywhere beneath.

The source unit must be specified as a pathname beginning with either
data/ or a campaign subdirectory name.  The destination may be the
name of a campaign or the special name "core", indicating the images
and sounds directories immediately beneath data/. All resource files
(images and sounds) referenced in the unit .cfg and included near it
move with it.

"Near" for a unit in the core data means anywhere in the core data,
but not in a campaign directory.  "Near" for a unit under a
data/campaign directory means anywhere in that same campaign
directory, but not in core data or any other campaign directory.

The script generates a sequence of shell commands.  These commands
will move the unit and all its resources are moved to appropriate
places under the target campaign or core directories.  Subversion move
commands will be used on version-controlled files.

The --revert option generates commands used to revert the result of a 
previous move, undoing SVN add and delete operations as needed.

Note: After performing a move generated with this command, use wmlscope
to check that you have not left any references to the moved units dangling.

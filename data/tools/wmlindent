wmlindent - re-indent WML in a uniform way.

By Eric S. Raymond, June 2007.

Call with no arguments to filter WML on stdin to reindented WML on
stdout.  If arguments are specified, they are taken to be files to be
re-indented in place; a directory name causes reindenting on all WML
beneath it.

The indent unit is four spaces.  Absence of an option to change this is
deliberate; the purpose of this tool is to *prevent* style wars, not encourage
them.

On non-empty lines, this code never modifies anything but leading and
trailing whitespace. Leading whitespace will be regularized to the
current indent; trailing whitespace will be stripped.  After processing
all lines will end with a Unix-style \n end-of-line marker.

Runs of entirely blank lines will be reduced to one blank line, except
in two cases where they will be discarded: (a) before WML closing
tags, and (b) after WML opening tags.

It is possible to wrap a section of lines in special comments so that
wmlindent will ignore them.  You may need to do this for unbalanced
macros (it's better, though, to get rid of those where possible).
Use 'wmlindent: {start,stop} ignoring' anywhere in a comment.

It is also possible to declare custom openers an closers, e.g for macros
that are actually control constructs.  To do this, use declarations

    # wmlindent: opener "{EXCEPTIONAL_OPENER "
    # wmlindent: closer "{EXCEPTIONAL_CLOSER "

The lines after an opener will be indented an extra level; a closer
and lines following will be indented one level less. Note that these
declare prefixes; any prefix match to the non-whitespace text of a line
will be recognized.

The public utility macros "{FOREACH" and "{NEXT" come as wired-in exceptions,
because it is not guaranteed that their indent declarations will be processed
before the macro library is reached.

Interrupting will be safe, as each reindenting will be done to a copy
that is atomically renamed when it's done.  If the output file is identical
to the input, the output file will simply be deleted, so the timestamp
on the input file won't be touched.

The --dryrun option detects and reports files that would be changed
without changing them. The --verbose or -v option enables reporting
of files that are (or would be, under --dryrun) changed.  With -v -v,
unchanged files are also reported.  The --exclude option takes a regexp
and excludes files matching it.

Note: This does not include a parser.  It will produce bad results on WML
that is syntactically unbalanced.  Unbalanced double quotes that aren't part
of a multiline literal will also confuse it.  You will receive warnings
if there's an indent open at end of file or if a closer occurs with
indent already zero; these two conditions strongly suggest unbalanced WML.

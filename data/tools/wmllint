# wmllint -- check WML for conformance to the most recent dialect
#
# By Eric S. Raymond April 2007.
#
#                              PURPOSE
#
# wmllint is a tool for porting and debugging WML (Wesnoth Markup Language).
# It can do much of the work of upgrading old content to a new version of
# Battle for Wesnoth, automatically.
#
# While the script is at it, it checks for various incorrect and dodgy WML
# constructs, including:
#   * unbalanced tags
#   * strings that need a translation mark and do not have them
#   * strings that have a translation mark and should not
#   * translatable strings containing macro references
#   * filter references by id= not matched by an actual unit
#   * consistency between recruit= and recruitment_pattern= instances
#   * unknown unit types in recruitment lists
#   * double space after punctuation in translatable strings.
#   * unknown races or movement types in units
#   * unknown base units
#   * misspellings in message and description strings
#
#                              BASIC PROCEDURE
#
# Takes any number of directories as arguments.  Each directory is converted.
# If no directories are specified, acts on the current directory.
#
# The recommended procedure is this:
# 1. Run it with --dryrun first to see what it will do.
# 2. If the messages look good, run without --dryrun; the old content
#    will be left in backup files with a -bak extension.
# 3. Eyeball the changes with the --diff option.
# 4. Use wmlscope, with a directory list including the Wesnoth mainline WML
#    as first argument, to check that you have no unresolved references.
# 5. Test the conversion.
# 6. Use either --clean to remove the -bak files or --revert to
#    undo the conversion.
#
# Compatibility with pre-1.4 versions has been removed; to port very old
# content, first run wmllint-1.4 to convert to "1.4", before running this
# one.
#
#
#                              MAGIC COMMENTS
#
# Note: You can shut wmllint up about custom terrains by having a comment
# on the same line that includes the string "wmllint: ignore" or
# "wmllint: noconvert". The same magic comments will also disable checking
# of translation marks, which may alternatively be toggled for line blocks
# with "wmllint: markcheck off" and "wmllint: markcheck on".
#
# You can also prevent description insertions with "wmllint: no-icon".
#
# You can force otherwise undeclared characters to be recognized with
# a magic comment containing the string "wmllint: recognize".
# The rest of the line is stripped and treated as the name of a character
# who should be recognized in descriptions.  This will be useful,
# for example, if your scenario follows a continue so there are
# characters present who were not explicitly recalled.  It may
# also be useful if you have wrapped unit-creation or recall markup in
# non-core macros and wmllint cannot recognize it.
#
# If you use custom macros to create (or recall) a named unit, you can tell
# wmllint which field contains the id with the string, "wmllint: whofield
# <macro> <number>".  After the macro's last use, *make sure* to remove it
# with "wmllint: whofield clear <macro>"; if "clear" is not followed by a
# macro name, all macros will be cleared from the list.  (If the <number>
# string was not a non-zero number, wmllint will also attempt to remove the
# specified macro.)
#
# For macros used in multiple scenarios to field characters, you can tell
# wmllint to recognize them with another magic comment:
#     wmllint: who <macro> is <character(s)>
# <Macro> should be the macro name; <character(s)> would be the ids of the
# recalled (or created) characters, comma-separated if there were more than
# one.  If more characters attach to a macro in later scenarios, they can be
# appended with additional "who" magic comments (though this requires scenarios
# to be numbered or otherwise sorted to work properly, as wmllint traverses
# files in alphabetical order).  If there is a character that drops out,
# preceding that person's entry with a double-minus will cause that character
# to be removed, e.g., "-- Garak".
#
# At the end of the campaign, *make sure* you use:
#     wmllint: unwho ALL
# This will clear the list of "who" magic comments and tell wmllint to stop
# checking for them in later files and directories.  If a specific macro is
# not used in subsequent scenarios, put "unwho <macro>" in its last scenario.
#
# Similarly, it is possible to explicitly declare a unit's usage class
# with a magic comment that looks like this:
#    wmllint: usage of <unit> is <class>
# Note that <unit> must be a string wrapped in ASCII doublequotes.  This
# declaration will be useful if you are declaring units with macros that
# include a substitutable formal in the unit name; there were examples in
# UtBS, but they have since been converted to use the [base_unit] tag.
#
# If a mismatch between a recruit list and recruitment pattern involves a
# usage type outside the five core types, the warning message will include a
# note that a non-standard usage class is involved.  If you are using custom
# usage classes and would like wmllint to be aware of them, you can insert
# the magic comment, "wmllint: usagetype <class>".  This comment will take a
# comma-separated list, and can also be pluralized to "usagetypes".
#
# You can disable stack-based malformation checks with a comment
# containing "wmllint: validate-off" and re-enable with "wmllint: validate-on".
#
# You can prevent filename conversions with a comment containing
# "wmllint: noconvert" on the same line as the filename.
#
# You can suppress complaints about files without an initial textdomain line
# by embedding the magic comment "# wmllint: no translatables" in the file.
# of course, it's a good idea to be sure this assertion is actually true.
#
# You can skip checks on unbalanced WML (e.g. in a macro definition) by
# bracketing it with "wmllint: unbalanced-on" and "wmllint: unbalanced-off".
# Note that this will also disable stack-based validation on the span
# of lines they enclose.
#
# A special comment "# wmllint: deathcheck off" will disable the check whether
# dying units speak in their death events.
# The comment "# wmllint: deathcheck on" will re-enable this check.
#
# A magic comment of the form "wmllint: general spellings word1
# word2..."  will declare the tokens word1, word2, etc. to be
# acceptable spellings for anywhere in the Wesnoth tree that the
# spellchecker should never flag.  If the keyword "general" is
# replaced by "local", the spelling exceptions apply only in the
# current file. If the keyword "general" is replaced by "directory",
# the spelling exceptions apply to all files below the parent
# directory.
#
# A comment containing "no spellcheck" disables spellchecking on the
# line where it occurs.
#
# wmllint will also make sure the sides in a scenario are in a continuous
# numerical sequence. However, if a side is defined in a macro the comment
# "#wmllint: skip-side" is needed where the macro is used in order to allow
# wmllint to account for it properly.
#
# In 1.11.5 and 1.11.6 respectively, the special ellipses for leaders and units
# without a ZoC are automatically handled by the C++ engine. wmllint warns if such
# ellipses are found in your WML and asks to remove them; at the same time it
# notifies of custom ellipses that may need to be updated (updating means that
# -nozoc, -leader and -leader-nozoc variations of your ellipse need to be added).
# You can disable this sanity check for the current line with the comment
# "# wmllint: no ellipsecheck".
#
# In the 1.13 development series, the ability to implement custom conditional
# tags by using Lua was added. wmllint, of course, doesn't handle Lua files,
# so to avoid having them incorrectly recognized as "illegal child of [if]"
# you can declare them with this magic comment:
# # wmllint: conditional tag <tag_name>
# Do not surround <tag_name> with square braces, because wmllint will do so
# automatically; on the other hand, you can specify multiple tags to be
# recognized as a comma-separated list.
#
#                              DEVELOPER INFORMATION
#
# All conversion logic for lifting WML and maps from older versions of the
# markup to newer ones should live here.  This includes resource path changes
# and renames, also map format conversions.
#
# Note: Lift logic for pre-1.4 versions has been removed; if you need it,
# use wmllint-1.4 to lift before running this one.  I did this for a policy
# reason; I wanted to kill off the --oldversion switch.  It will *not*
# be restored; in future, changes to WML syntax *must* be forward
# compatible in such a way that tags from old versions can be
# unambiguously recognized (this will save everybody heartburn).  As a
# virtuous side effect, this featurectomy cuts wmllint's code
# complexity by over 50%, improves performance by about 33%, and
# banishes some annoying behaviors related to the 1.2 map-conversion
# code.

        Explanation:

Windows' use of the backslash as a directory separator is clashing with the use of the backslash as an escape. As an escape, the backslash tells your system that you want a normally special character to be its literal self (or sometimes, that you want a normally ordinary character to have a special meaning). Your system interprets '\"' as an escape for a literal quote character. Two quotes together are also interpreted as a literal quote.

'"Campaign\"' is interpreted as 'Campaign"' instead of 'Campaign\'.
'"My Folder\"Campaign' is interpreted as 'My Folder"Campaign' (not 'My Folder\Campaign').
'"My Folder\Campaign\" "My Folder\Another_Campaign"' is interpreted as 'My Folder\Campaign" My' and 'Folder\Another_Campaign'.

In your case, your system interprets your arguments as:

    %s

        Solutions:

(1) If your problem is adjoining quotes, delete (or move) one of them
(  "folder\Campaign"" -> "folder\Campaign"  )

(2) If you are using a final backslash at the end of a directory address, it is not necessary
(  "folder\Campaign\\" -> "folder\Campaign" -- but NOT "folder\Campaign\\"file.cfg -> "folder\Campaign"file.cfg  )

(3) If you add a second backslash, your system will then escape the backslash instead of the quote
(  "folder\Campaign\\" -> "folder\Campaign\\\\"  )

(4) Frontslashes will also be recognized as directory separators
(  "folder\Campaign\\" -> "folder/Campaign"  )

(5) If there are no spaces in your address, it is not necessary to use quotes
(  "folder\Campaign\\" -> folder\Campaign -- but NOT "My Folder\Campaign\\" -> My Folder\Campaign  )

(6) You can move the affected quote
(  M"y Folder\\"Campaign -> M"y Fold"er\Campaign -- but NOT Fil"es and Folders\My Folder\\"Campaign -> Fil"es and Folders\M"y Folder\Campaign  )

        Reminder:

(a) Hit the up arrow key. The up and down arrows move through your command history; one press of the up arrow will take you to your last command.
(b) Edit your command. Use any of the solutions described above.

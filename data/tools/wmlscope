# wmlscope -- generate reports on WML macro and resource usage
#
# By Eric S. Raymond, April 2007.
#
# This tool cross-references macro definitions with macro calls, and
# resource (sound or image) files with uses of the resources in WML.
# and generates various useful reports from such cross-references.
#
# (Most of the work is done by a cross-referencer class that is also
# used elsewhere, e.g. by wmlmove.) 
#
# It takes a list of directories as arguments; if none is given, it
# behaves as though the current directory had been specified as a
# single argument.  Each directory is treated as a separate domain for
# macro and resource visibility purposes, except that macros and resources
# under the first directory are made visible in all later ones.  (Typically
# the first directory should point at a copy of mainline and all later
# ones at UMC.)
#
# This tool does catch one kind of implicit reference: if an attack name
# is specified but no icon is given, the attack icon will default to
# a name generated from the attack name.  This behavior can be suppressed
# by adding a magic comment containing the string "no-icon" to the name= line.
#
# The checking done by this tool has a couple of flaws:
#
# (1) It doesn't actually evaluate file inclusions.  Instead, any
# macro definition satisfies any macro call made under the same
# directory.  Exception: when an #undef is detected, the macro is
# tagged local and not visible outside the span of lines where it's
# defined.
#
# (2) It doesn't read [binary_path] tags, as this would require
# implementing a WML parser.  Instead, it assumes that a resource-file
# reference can be satisfied by any matching image file from anywhere
# in the same directory it came from.  The resources under the *first*
# directory argument (only) are visible everywhere.
#
# (3) A reference with embedded {}s in a macro will have the macro's
# formal args substituted in at WML evaluation time.  Instead, this
# tool treats each {} as a .* wildcard and considers the reference to
# match *every* resource filename that matches that pattern.  Under
# appropriate circumstances this might report a resource filename
# statically matching the pattern as having been referenced even
# though none of the actual macro calls would actually generate it.
#
# Problems (1) and (2) imply that this tool might conceivably report
# that a reference has been satisfied when under actual
# WML-interpreter rules it has not.
#
# The reporting format is compatible with GNU Emacs compile mode.

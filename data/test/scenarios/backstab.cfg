    # Given a set of directions, create units around Bob.  One of those units
    # makes an attack, and the damage dealt is compared to the expectation that
    # the ABILITY_SHOULD_ACTIVATE.
    #
    # Note: the directions given are the direction of Bob from the spawn, so
    # ('n','se','sw') spawns units ('s,'nw','ne') of Bob. The order that the
    # units spawn might not match the order of the ANTIDIRECTIONS argument.
    #
    # Any commands in EXTRA_SETUP are run after spawning the units but before
    # making the attack. This code can access the new units via the
    # spawn_points array.
    #
    # The unit on hex spawn_points[0] then attacks Bob, and the test asserts
    # that Bob has the expected number of hit points remaining.

#####
# API(s) being tested: [slow]apply_to=opponent
##
# Actions:
# This uses a "common keep" map, so Alice and Bob are already in position to attack.
# Give Alice a weapon that does reverse-slow (Alice gets slowed if Bob hits her).
# Simulate various combats using melee weapons.
##
# Expected end state:
# Normal combat can slow Alice.
# Making Alice unslowable works.
# Making Bob unslowable does not affect Alice, except for the damage taken.
# Making Bob slowed before combat starts does not affect Alice, except for the damage taken.

# The purpose of this test is to check that units spawned on
# an occupied hex are placed at the nearest available vacant hex.

#####
# API(s) being tested: [unit]
##
# Actions:
# Spawn several Orcish Grunts for side 2, one at 3,4 and five more in a circle around it leaving only 3,5 vacant.
# Spawn another Orcish Grunt for side 1 at 3,4.
##
# Expected end state:
# The side 1 Orcish Grunt is placed on the 3,5 hex.

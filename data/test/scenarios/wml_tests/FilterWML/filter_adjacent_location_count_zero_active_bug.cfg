#####
# API(s) being tested: ability[filter_adjacent_location]adjacent,count=
##
# Actions:
# Give Alice an ability specialX, which is only active if zero of the adjacent units have specialY.
# No unit has specialY.
# Test whether the ability is active.
##
# Expected end state:
# Although specialX should be active, it isn't.

{COMMON_KEEP_A_B_C_D_UNIT_TEST "filter_adjacent_location_count_zero_active_bug" (
    # Although this ability is meant to be active when the count of adjacent units with specialY is
    # zero, the C++ implementation in abilities.cpp returns false (in several places) unless each
    # direction listed in adjacent= contains a unit with that ability.
    #
    # It would be good to fix it before 1.20, but would be a behavior change so can't be backported
    # to 1.18. When fixing the bug, this test should be renamed without the "_bug" suffix.

# This test is a variation of backstab_inactive_with_statue_behind_bob.
##
# Actions:
# Bob is made to have 0% defense and given 100 hp.
# A Rogue is spawned north and south of Bob.
# The south Rogue is petrified.
# The north Rogue attacks Bob.
# In the pre-attack event, the backstab is replaced by one whose filter passes iff the south Rogue is petrified.
##
# Expected end state:
# The damage shows that the ability was active.
# Bob gets hit all three times and ends with 100-(6 * 3 * 2) hp.

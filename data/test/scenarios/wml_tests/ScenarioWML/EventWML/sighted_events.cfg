#textdomain wesnoth-test

# This test checks that sighted events are being triggered correctly due to units moving.
# Whether that's the viewer moving and revealing hexes in the fog, or whether that's the enemy units moving into the already-revealed hexes.

#####
# API(s) being tested: [event]name=sighted
##
# Actions:
# Enable fog for side 1.
# Move alice and bob around the map.
##
# Expected end state:
# The number of sighted events triggered matches the expected value.

# API(s) being tested: [event]priority=
##
# Actions:
# Set X to 1 in the prestart event.
# In a start event handler with negative priority: Check if X is 1, Set X to 2.
# In a start event handler with the same priority: Check if X is 2.
##
# Expected end state:
# The test passes when the second event is executed last.

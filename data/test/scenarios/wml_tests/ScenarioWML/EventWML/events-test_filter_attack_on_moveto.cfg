# wmllint: no translatables

#####
# API(s) being tested: [event][filter_attack],[event]name=moveto
##
# Actions:
# Put a [filter_attack] in a non-attack event.
# Perform that action that would trigger that event, if the filter wasn't present.
##
# Expected end state:
# The event doesn't trigger.
# No errors are shown (checked both by strict mode, and also by reaching the SUCCEED).

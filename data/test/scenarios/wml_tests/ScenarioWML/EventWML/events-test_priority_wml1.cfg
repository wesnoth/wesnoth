#####
# API(s) being tested: [event]priority=
##
# Actions:
# Set X to 1 in the prestart event.
# Add a low-priority start event handler.
# In a new high-priority start event: Check if X is 1, Set X to 2.
# In the added low-priority start event handler: Check if X is 2.
##
# Expected end state:
# The test passes when the low-priority event is executed last.

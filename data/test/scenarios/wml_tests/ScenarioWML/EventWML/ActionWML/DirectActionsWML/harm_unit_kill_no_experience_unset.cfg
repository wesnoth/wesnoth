# wmllint: no translatables

#####
# API(s) being tested: [harm_unit]
##
# Actions:
# Set all units to a known number of hitpoints.
# Both of these have Alice as the harmer.
# Use [harm_unit] with Bob as the victim, and a fatal amount of damage but with kill=no.
# Use [harm_unit] with Charlie and Dave as victims, and a fatal amount of damage but with kill=no.
##
# Expected end state:
# The victims get reduced to 1 hp, but survive.
# Alice and Bob get 1 experience point each for the first fight.
# Alice gets 2 experience points for the second fight, Charlie and Dave get 1 each.

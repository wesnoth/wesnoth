# wmllint: no translatables

# If we were designing the API anew, then [end_turn] before side 1 has even started its turn would
# probably be treated as an error. However, it's worked this way for ages and has been tested to
# work this way since 1.13.11.

#####
# API(s) being tested: [event],[end_turn]
##
# Actions:
# In a "turn X" event, before any side has started their "side turn", end the current side's turn.
##
# Expected end state:
# It ends side 1's turn.

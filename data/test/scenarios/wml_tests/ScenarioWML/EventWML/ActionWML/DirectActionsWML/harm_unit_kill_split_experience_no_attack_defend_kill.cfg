# wmllint: no translatables

#####
# API(s) being tested: [harm_unit]
##
# Actions:
# Set Alice, Charlie and Dave to a known number of hitpoints.
# Set Bob to a known but higher number of hitpoints.
# Use [harm_unit] with Alice as harmer, the others as victims, and damage equal to Charlie's hitpoints.
# Comma-separated list in experience key works additively, that means that "no" in it should have no effect.
##
# Expected end state:
# Alice gets 17 experience points, Bob gets 1, Charlie and Dave die.

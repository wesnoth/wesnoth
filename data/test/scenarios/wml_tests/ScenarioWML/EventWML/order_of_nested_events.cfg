# The purpose of this test is to check that a First in, First out order of events is being respected.
# The outer event should run first because all of the events in [scenario] are registered before any of them is executed.

#####
# API(s) being tested: [event]
##
# Actions:
# Set X to 1 in the prestart event.
# Set X to 0 in a nested start event.
# Check if X is 1 in a non-nested start event.
##
# Expected end state:
# The nested start event runs after the non-nested start event.

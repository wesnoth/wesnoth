# API(s) being tested: [event][filter_attack]
##
# Actions:
# Remove Alice's melee attack.
# Give Alice an ability that adds a drain special to all of his weapons.
# Define events that use filter_attack matching Alice's drain special.
# Have Alice use a ranged attack against Bob, who only has a melee attack.
# Have Bob use a melee attack against Alice.
##
# Expected end state:
# An event triggers when Alice attacks during side 1's turn.
# No event triggers when Bob attacks Alice.

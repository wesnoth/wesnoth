# wmllint: no translatables

#####
# API(s) being tested: [unit][advancement]
##
# Actions:
# Harm Alice and Bob with 1 hitpoint to be sure that they have some damage. Delete advancements of both units and give them 999 experience. They then fight each other.
##
# Expected end state:
# Bob and Alice doesn't level up, keeps their HP, and gains experience. The default behaviour should be that a unit will never advances if it has no advancements, but still can gain experience internally (seen with inspect console).

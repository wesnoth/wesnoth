# API(s) being tested: [specials][plague],[abilities][plague]affect_allies=yes
##
# Actions:
# This uses a "common keep" map, with Alice and Bob already adjacent to the other units.
# Give Bob a plague weapon special that creates Blood Bats.
# Make Charlie teach a plague ability that creates Chocobones.
# Make Dave teach a plague ability that creates Dragonguards.
# Create targets around Alice and Bob.
# Have Alice and Bob kill 1 target each.
# Remove Charlie and Dave.
# Have Alice and Bob kill 1 target each.
##
# Expected end state:
# Alice's attacks created 1 unit of a type taught by Charlie or Dave.
# Bob's own weapon special had priority over Charlie and Dave's teaching ability.
# Bob's attacks created 2 Blood Bats.

# API(s) being tested: [chance_to_hit]base_stat=
##
# Actions:
# Modify defense of units for have 70% to strikes without use of [chance_to_hit]
# Give the leaders a chance_to_hit ability with both the base_stat and sub attributes and a chance_to_hit with both value and cumulative attribute
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# The side 1 leader's first weapon strikes 100 times, because the normal [chance_to_hit]value,cumulative=100,yes is higher than the modified base value 100 (base value) - 10 (base_stat [chance_to_hit]sub=10)=90
# The side 1 leader's second weapon strikes 100 times, because the normal [chance_to_hit]value,cumulative=100,yes is higher than the modified base value 100 (base value) - 10 (base_stat [chance_to_hit]sub=10)=90

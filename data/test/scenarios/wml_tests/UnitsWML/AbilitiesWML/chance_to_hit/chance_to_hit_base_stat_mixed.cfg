# API(s) being tested: [chance_to_hit]base_stat=
##
# Actions:
# Give the leaders a chance_to_hit ability with both the base_stat and value attributes and a chance_to_hit with value attribute
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# The side 1 leader's first weapon strikes 0 times, because the normal [chance_to_hit]value=0 completely replaces the base value
# The side 1 leader's second weapon strikes 0 times, because the normal [chance_to_hit]value=0 completely replaces the base value

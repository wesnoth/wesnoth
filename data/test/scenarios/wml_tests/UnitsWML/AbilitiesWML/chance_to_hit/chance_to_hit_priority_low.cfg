# API(s) being tested: [chance_to_hit]priority=
##
# Actions:
# Give the leaders a chance_to_hit ability with both the priority and value attributes
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# The side 1 leader's first weapon strikes 0 times, because [chance_to_hit]value=100 has lower priority than [chance_to_hit]value=0
# The side 1 leader's second weapon strikes 0 times, because [chance_to_hit]value=100 has lower priority than [chance_to_hit]value=0

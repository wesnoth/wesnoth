#####
# API(s) being tested: [drains]overwrite_specials=
##
# Actions:
# Give the side 1 leader a drains ability with the overwrite_specials=one_side attribute
# Give the side 1 leader a drains ability with priority=10
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# The side 1 leader has 2 weapons each of which now drains 2 hp, since the 1 hp drains ability can't takes priority

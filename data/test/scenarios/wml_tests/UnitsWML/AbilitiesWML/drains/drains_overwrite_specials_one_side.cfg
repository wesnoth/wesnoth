# wmllint: no translatables

#####
# API(s) being tested: [drains]overwrite_specials=
##
# Actions:
# Give the side 1 leader a drains ability with the overwrite_specials=one_side attribute
# Give the side 1 leader a drains ability without the overwrite_specials attribute
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# The side 1 leader has 2 weapons each of which now drains 2 hp, since the 2 hp drains ability takes priority due to overwrite_specials

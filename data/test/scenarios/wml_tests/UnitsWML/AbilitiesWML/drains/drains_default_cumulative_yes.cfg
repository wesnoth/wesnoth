# wmllint: no translatables

#####
# API(s) being tested: [drains]cumulative=
##
# Actions:
# Give the leaders a drains ability with non-unique IDs with cumulative=yes
# The drains abilities give a lower value than drains' default of 50% gives
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# The side 1 leader has 2 weapons both of which drain 50 hp (50% of 100), since the 50% default gives a higher value

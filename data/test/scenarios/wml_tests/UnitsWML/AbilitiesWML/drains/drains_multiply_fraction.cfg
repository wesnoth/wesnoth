# API(s) being tested: [drains]value=
##
# Actions:
# Give the leaders a drains ability with both the value and multiply attributes
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# The both leaders have 2 weapons each of which now drains 6 hp (3*2, the .5 is truncated)
# The leader of side 1 heals 6 hp total since it has full hp when its first strike is made
# The leader of side 2 heals 12 hp total since it was damaged when its first strike was made

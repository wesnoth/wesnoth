# API(s) being tested: [swarm]affect_enemies=
##
# Actions:
# Give the side 1 leader a swarm ability that only affects adjacent enemies
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# alice is unaffected by any swarm ability while bob is affected
# alice has 2 strikes per attack for the first weapon and 4 strikes per attack for the second weapon
# bob has 10 strikes for the first attack of the first weapon and 9 strikes for the second attack (27/29, rounded down)
# bob has 10 strikes for the first attack of the second weapon and 8 strikes for the second attack (25/29, rounded down)

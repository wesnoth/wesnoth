# API(s) being tested: [swarm][filter_student]
##
# Actions:
# Give bob an ability that gives adjacent allied units the swarm ability with a min and max strikes of 1, if they are Orcish Grunts.
# Spawn an allied Orcish Grunt and Blood Bat next to bob.
# Spawn an enemy Dark Adept next to bob's allied units.
# Have the allied units attack the Dark Adept.
##
# Expected end state:
# The Orcish Grunt strikes the Dark Adept 1 time instead of 2 times.
# The Blood Bat strikes the Dark Adept the default 3 times.

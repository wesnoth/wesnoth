# API(s) being tested: [swarm]overwrite_specials=
##
# Actions:
# Give the side 1 leader a swarm ability with the overwrite_specials=both_sides attribute
# Give the side 1 leader a swarm ability without the overwrite_specials attribute
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# For both weapons, the first attack has 10 strikes and the second attack has 6 strikes (19/29, rounded down), overwrite_specials ability takes priority

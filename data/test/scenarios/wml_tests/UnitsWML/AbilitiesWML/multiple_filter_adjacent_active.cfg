#####
# API(s) being tested: ability[filter_adjacent]adjacent,count=
##
# Actions:
# Give Alice an ability specialX, which is only active if one adjacent unit is bob with another [filter_adjacent] who don't match.
# Test whether the ability is active.
##
# Expected end state:
# specialX should be active because one [filter_adjacent] only is needed for validate the checking.

# API(s) being tested: [resistance]cumulative=
##
# Actions:
# Both units are Skeletons, with a blade attack and 40% resistance to blade
# Give all units 20% resistance to all damage types with cumulative=no
# Give all units 30% resistance to all damage types with cumulative=no
# Both abilities have unique ids
# Attack each other
##
# Expected end state:
# The damage from the attack is reduced by 30%

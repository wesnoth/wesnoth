# API(s) being tested: [resistance]affect_allies= with [affect_adjacent]radius=2
##
# Actions:
# Make sides 1 and 2 allies
# Give side 1's allies within radius of 2 50% resistance to all damage types
# Have side 2 attack side 3
# Have side 4 attack side 1
##
# Expected end state:
# The damage from the attack is reduced by 50% for allies (you are not allied with yourself)
# The damage from the attack is not reduced for others

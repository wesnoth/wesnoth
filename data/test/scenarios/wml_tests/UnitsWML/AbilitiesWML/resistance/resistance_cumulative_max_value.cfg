# API(s) being tested: [resistance]cumulative=
##
# Actions:
# Give all units 20% resistance to all damage types with max_value=15 and cumulative=yes
# Give all units 30% resistance to all damage types with max_value=17 and cumulative=yes
# Give all units 20% resistance to all damage types with max_value=15 and cumulative=yes
# All abilities have unique ids
# Attack each other
##
# Expected end state:
# In 1.18, the cumulative effect is 30% resistance with a max_value of 47.
# The damage from the attack is reduced by 30%

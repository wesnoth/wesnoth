# wmllint: no translatables

#####
# API(s) being tested: [teleport][tunnel]
##
# Actions:
# Give side 1 units the ability to teleport but that has a tunnel defined that uses teleport_unit in its target
# Move side 1's leader to the edge of the map
# Place a village next to side 1's leader and side 2's leader
# Reduce side 1's leader's movement so that it can't reach side 2's leader without teleporting
# Make side 1 be AI controlled since a decision needs to be made while playing to teleport from one village to another which can't otherwise be simulated
##
# Expected end state:
# Side 1's leader is able to attack side 2's leader since the target village is owned by side 1

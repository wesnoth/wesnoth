# API(s) being tested: [added_accuracy]add=
##
# Actions:
# Give the leaders a added_accuracy ability with both the value and add attributes, adding up to 90
# Give the leaders a added_accuracy ability with both the cumulative and add attributes, adding 10.
# Give each unit 1000 hp and 100 strikes
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# The side 1 leader's first weapon don't strikes 100 times, because cumulative don't work for attributes other what value=
# The side 1 leader's second weapon don't strikes 100 times, because cumulative don't work for attributes other what value=

# API(s) being tested: [defense]overwrite_specials=
##
# Actions:
# Give the side 1 leader a defense ability with the overwrite_specials=both_sides attribute
# Give the side 1 leader a defense ability without the overwrite_specials attribute
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# The side 1 leader has 2 weapons which strike 100 times, since the 100 value ability takes priority due to overwrite_specials

# wmllint: no translatables

#####
# API(s) being tested: [defense]priority=
##
# Actions:
# Give the leaders a defense ability with both the value of 0 and priority attributes and another defense of value of 100
# Give each unit 1000 hp and 100 strikes
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# The side 1 leader's first weapon strikes 100 times, because priority of value=0 is higher what for value=100
# The side 1 leader's second weapon strikes 100 times

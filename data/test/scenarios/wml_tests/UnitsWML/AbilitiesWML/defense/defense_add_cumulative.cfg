# Give the leaders a defense ability with both the value and add attributes, adding up to 90

# Give each unit 1000 hp and 100 strikes
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# The side 1 leader's first weapon don't strikes 0 times, because cumulative don't work for attributes other what value=

# API(s) being tested: [heal_on_hit]base_stat=
##
# Actions:
# Give the leaders a heal_on_hit ability with both the base_stat and value attributes and a heal_on_hit with value attribute
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# The both leaders have 2 weapons each of which now heals 6 hp(value=6 is highest value because of cumulative)
# The leader of side 1 heals 6 hp total since it has full hp when its first strike is made
# The leader of side 2 heals 12 hp total since it was damaged when its first strike was made

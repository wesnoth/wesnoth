#####
# API(s) being tested: [heal_on_hit]overwrite_specials=
##
# Actions:
# Give the side 1 leader a heal_on_hit ability with the overwrite_specials=both_sides attribute
# Give the side 1 leader a heal_on_hit ability without the overwrite_specials attribute
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# The side 1 leader has 2 weapons each of which now heals 2 hp, since the 2 hp heal_on_hit ability takes priority due to overwrite_specials

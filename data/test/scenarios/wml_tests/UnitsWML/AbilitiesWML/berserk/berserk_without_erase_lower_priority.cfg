# API(s) being tested: [berserk]priority=
##
# Actions:
# Give the side 1 leader a berserk ability with the priority=10 attribute
# Give the side 1 leader a berserk ability without the priority attribute
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# The side 1 leader has 2 weapons which strike 14 (2*7) and 24 (4*7) times, since the 5 value ability can't takes priority without [suppress_lower_priority]

# wmllint: no translatables

#####
# API(s) being tested: [damage_type]replacement_type=
##
# Actions:
# Give the leaders two damage_type abilities with a pierce type
# Give the leaders one damage_type ability with a blade type
# Give the leaders a melee weapon for each of the 6 mainline damage types
# Give the leaders a 100% weakness to pierce damage
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with all its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# The side 1 leader has 6 weapons all of which deal 4 damage since it uses the pierce damage type (most instances of damage_type)

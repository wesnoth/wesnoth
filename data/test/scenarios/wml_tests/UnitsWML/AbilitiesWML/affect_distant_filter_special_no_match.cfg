#####
# API(s) being tested: [filter_self][filter_weapon][filter_special] with a ability[affect_adjacent]radius=
##
# Actions:
# Give charlie an ability specialX, which is affect alice if she in 10 hexes of distance of alex.
# Add specialY active if alice affected by specialX to all attacks alice.
# Move bob adjacent to alice and doing them fight.
# Test whether the alice damage are increased by specialY
##
# Expected end state:
# alice inflict 150 hp loss to bob, specialY no active because [filter_special] don't matches wit specialX.

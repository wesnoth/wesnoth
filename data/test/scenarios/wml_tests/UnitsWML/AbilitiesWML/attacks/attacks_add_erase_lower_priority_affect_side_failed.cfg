#####
# API(s) being tested: [attacks][suppress_lower_priority]affect_side=
##
# Actions:
# Give the leaders an attacks ability with both add attributes and priority=10 and filter for erase other abilities with sub applied to opponent.
# Give leaders an attacks ability who decrease attack of opponent of 4.
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# The side 1 leader has 2 weapons each of which now has 2 strikes (5+1-4), because sub=4 not erased by affect_side who erase aplied to self only.

# wmllint: no translatables

#####
# API(s) being tested: [attacks]overwrite_specials=
##
# Actions:
# Give the side 1 leader an attacks ability with the overwrite_specials=one_side attribute
# Give the side 1 leader an attacks ability without the overwrite_specials attribute
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# The side 1 leader has 2 weapons each of which now has 5 strikes, since the 5 strike ability takes priority due to overwrite_specials

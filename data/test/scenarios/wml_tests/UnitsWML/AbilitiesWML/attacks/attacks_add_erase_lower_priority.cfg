#####
# API(s) being tested: [attacks][filter_lower_priority]
##
# Actions:
# Give the leaders an attacks ability with both the value and add attributes and suppress_priority=10 and filter for erase other abilities similar to lower priority.

# The side 1 leader has 2 weapons each of which now has 6 strikes (5+1), because sub=4 not used

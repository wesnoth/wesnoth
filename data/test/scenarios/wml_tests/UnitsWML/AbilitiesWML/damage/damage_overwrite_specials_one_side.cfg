# API(s) being tested: [damage]overwrite_specials=
##
# Actions:
# Give the side 1 leader a damage ability with the overwrite_specials=one_side attribute
# Give the side 1 leader a damage ability without the overwrite_specials attribute
# Have the side 1 leader attack the side 2 leader with both its weapons
##
# Expected end state:
# The side 1 leader has 2 weapons each of which now has 2 damage, since the 2 damage ability takes priority due to overwrite_specials

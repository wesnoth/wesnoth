# API(s) being tested: ability[affect_adjacent]adjacent=
##
# Actions:
# Place a 'teacher' unit on the map with specialX that affects adjacent units to n, nw or ne of the teacher (while alice is in se).
# Test whether the ability affect alice.
##
# Expected end state:
# specialX shouldn't be active for alice.

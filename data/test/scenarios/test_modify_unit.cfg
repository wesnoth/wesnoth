# wmllint: no translatables

# In 1.14 and before, the implementation of [modify_unit] always stored and
# unstored the unit. 1.16 introduced a "fast-path" which optimised setting some
# attributes, but which changed the behavior of the API in some edge cases.
#
# The store and unstore also ensured that the animation code noticed the
# change, and the fast path meant that changes for facing or low hitpoints
# failed to change the animation (issue 4978). However, that's a UI issue which
# doesn't affect the API, can't be automatically tested via the WML test
# framework, and which could be fixed during a stable branch.

# In this test, changing the side of a unit on a side's recall list needs to
# have the side-effect of moving it to the correct side's recall list.

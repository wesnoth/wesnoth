# The purpose of this test is to make a scenario that plays but goes out of sync with the replay.
# This is done as a sanity check of the unit testing mechanism.
# We use the unsynced rng, lua.random, to achieve this.
# Basically we keep giving side 1 a random amount of gold and recruiting as
# many woses as possible, killing them immediately to make space. We do this
# for 60 turns. In the replay we will actually have a random amount of gold
# each time, so if we have bad luck one turn we won't have enough to afford
# that many woses.
# For each turn its about 50-50 not to go out of sync, so the chance not to
# go out of sync (for true randomness) would be ~ 2^{-60}.
# (However none of our generators use more than 32 bits per seed.)

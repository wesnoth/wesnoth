# The [unit] tag can recall units if a unit with that id already exists
# on the recall list. Some edge cases were unclear, so this test finds
# out what they do.
#
# This is a test where any failure should probably be fixed by changing the
# test to match changes in the engine. Having the test will be useful for
# reference to find out when the engine behavior changed.

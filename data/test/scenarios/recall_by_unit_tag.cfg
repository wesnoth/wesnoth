# wmllint: no translatables

# This is a test where any failure should probably be fixed by changing the
# test to match changes in the engine. Having the test will be useful for
# reference to find out when the engine behavior changed.

#####
# API(s) being tested: [have_unit]search_recall_list=
##
# Actions:
# Spawn a unit on the recall list.
# Move the unit from the recall list to the map.
##
# Expected end state:
# [have_unit] finds the unit on the recall list when it's on the recall list, and not when it's been moved from the recall list to the map.

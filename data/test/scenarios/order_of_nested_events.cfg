# The purpose of this test is to check that a First in, First out
# order of events is being respected.
#
# A variable X is set to 1 during prestart, and just after
# a start event is registered which would set it to 0.
#
# Within the scenario tag, a start event is also registered
# to return (X == 1).
#
# If the "nested" event runs before the outer level start event,
# we fail the test. The outer event should run first because
# all of the events in [scenario] are registered before any
# of them is executed.

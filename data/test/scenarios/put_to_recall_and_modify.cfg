#textdomain wesnoth-test

# This is almost the same as the modify_unit_which_recall_list test, except that
# creating Charlie on the map can leave an on-map x,y pair in Charlie's data,
# which needs to be handled within the WML API.

#####
# API(s) being tested: [put_to_recall_list], [modify_unit], [role][auto_recall]
##
# Actions:
# Create Charlie, belonging to side 1, on the map.
# Repose Charlie on the recall list.
# Assign Charlie to side 2.
# Recall Charlie next to his side's leader.
##
# Expected end state:
# Charlie is on the map next to side 2's leader.

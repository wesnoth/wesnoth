Battle for Wesnoth is a turn-based fantasy strategy game somewhat unusual among modern strategy games. While other games strive for complexity, both in rules and gameplay, Battle for Wesnoth strives for simplicity of rules and gameplay. This does not make the game simple, however - from these simple rules arise a wealth of strategy, making the game easy to learn but a challenge to master."

title= _ "Fundamentals of Gameplay"
text= _ "This page outlines all you need to know to play Battle for Wesnoth. It covers how to play and the basic mechanics behind the game. Keep in mind that this is just an outline - for special exceptions and situations, please follow the links included." + _"

To begin with, it's best to click the <italic>text=Tutorial</italic> button at the main menu. This will take you to the interactive tutorial, which will teach you the basics of Wesnoth. After this, it is recommended that you play the Heir to the Throne campaign first - click <italic>text=Campaign</italic> then <italic>text='Heir to the Throne'</italic>. As Battle for Wesnoth can be quite challenging, you may wish to start on <italic>text=Easy</italic>." + "

<img>src=help/tooltip.png align=right float=yes</img>" + 
_"While playing, keep in mind that if you mouse-over many items on the menu bar to the right, a brief description will pop up explaining each item. This is especially useful when you encounter new abilities for the first time."

id=recruit_and_recall
title= _ "Recruiting and Recalling"
text="<img>src=help/recruit.png align=left float=yes</img>" + _"At the start of any battle, and at times during it, you will need to recruit units into your army. To recruit, you must have your leader (Konrad in the Heir to the Throne campaign) on the Keep square of a Castle. Then you may recruit by either choosing Recruit from the menu or right-clicking on a hex and selecting <italic>text=Recruit</italic>. This brings up the recruit menu, which lists units available for recruitment, along with their gold cost. Click on a unit to see its statistics to the left, then press the recruit button to recruit it." + _"

If you right-clicked on a castle hex and selected recruit, the new unit will appear in that square. Otherwise, it will appear in a free square near the keep. You may only recruit as many units as you have free hexes in your castle, and you cannot spend more gold than you actually have on recruiting." + _"

Recruited units come with two random <ref>dst=traits text=Traits</ref> which modify their statistics." + _"

In later scenarios, you may also Recall survivors from earlier battles. Recalling functions identically to Recruiting, save that recalling costs a standard 20 gold and presents you with a list of all surviving units from previous scenarios." + _"

Keep in mind that units not only cost gold to Recruit or Recall, they also require money to support. See <ref>dst=income_and_upkeep text='Income and Upkeep'</ref> for more information."
[/topic]

[topic]
id=movement
title= _ "Movement"
text= _ "Movement in Battle for Wesnoth is simple: Simply click on the unit you wish to move, then click on the hex you wish to move it to. When a unit is selected, everywhere it can move this turn will be highlighted, and all other hexes on the map are made dull. Mousing over a dull hex will show the number of turns required to reach it, and clicking will cause the unit to move towards it by the fastest route over this and subsequent turns." + _"

Each unit has a certain number of movement points which are expended when moving into a new hex, depending on the Terrain of that particular hex. For instance, grassland nearly always costs 1 movement point to enter. Exactly how many movement points are spent entering a hex depends on the unit type - in forest, elvish units only spend 1 movement point, most human and orc units spend 2, while horsemen spend 3. You can learn how many movement points a unit requires to enter a certain terrain type by right-clicking on it, selecting Unit Description, and then look at <italic>text='Terrain Modifiers'</italic>." + _"

Another thing to keep in mind while moving is Zones of Control. Each unit generates a zone of control in the hexes immediately surrounding it, and any enemy unit entering those hexes immediately ends its movement. Learning how to use zones of control to your advantage is an important part of Wesnoth, as only <ref>dst=ability_skirmisher text='Skirmishers'</ref> can ignore zones of control."
[/topic]

[topic]
id=combat
title= _ "Combat"
text= _ "There are two types of combat in Battle for Wesnoth, short- and long-ranged, but both of them take place between units in adjacent hexes. Short-range combat usually involves weapons such as swords, axes or fangs, while long-range combat usually involves weapons such as bows, spears and fireballs. Combat is relatively straightforward; the attacker and defender alternate attacks until each has used their allotted number of attacks." + _"

<header>text='Order and number of attacks'</header>" + _"

The attacker gets the first attack, then the defender retaliates. This continues to alternate until each unit has used up all of its attacks. The number of attacks a unit has varies; for instance, an Elvish fighter with a 5-4 sword attack may make 4 swings each dealing 5 damage, while an Orcish Grunt with 9-2 can only make 2 swings (but at 9 damage each)." + _"

<header>text='Chance to hit'</header>" + _"

With two exceptions, the chance to hit a unit is based solely on its defense rating in the Terrain it is currently standing in. This may be found by right-clicking a unit, selecting Unit Description, and then looking at <italic>text='Terrain Modifiers'</italic>. For instance, many elves have a defense rating of 70% in forest, meaning a unit attacking them has only a 30% chance of hitting them. Conversely, the elf's chance of hitting the attacker in return depends on what terrain the attacker is in." + _"
There are two exceptions to this rule: <ref>dst=weaponspecial_magical text='Magical attacks'</ref> and <ref>dst=weaponspecial_marksman text=Marksmen</ref>. Magical attacks always have a 70% chance to hit, regardless of terrain, and, when used offensively, Marksmen always have at least a 60% chance to hit, regardless of terrain." + _"

<header>text=Damage</header>" + _"

Each blow which hits causes a base amount of damage depending on the attack type. For instance, an Elvish Fighter with a 5-4 sword attack causes a base of 5 damage. This is usually modified by two things: <ref>dst=damage_types_and_resistance text=Resistance</ref> and <ref>dst=time_of_day text='Time of Day'</ref>, both of which are explained below." + _"

A few units have special abilities which affect damage dealt in combat. The most common of these is <ref>dst=weaponspecial_charge text=Charge</ref>, which doubles the damage dealt by both attacker and defender when the unit with Charge attacks."

id=damage_types_and_resistance
title= _ "Damage Types and Resistance"
text= _ "In Wesnoth, there are three types of damage usually associated with physical attacks: Blade, Pierce and Impact damage. Additionally, there are three further types of damage usually associated with magical attacks: Fire, Cold and Holy attacks. Different units may have resistances which alter the damage which they take from certain damage types." + _"

Resistances work very simply: If a unit has 40% resistance against a damage type, then they will suffer 40% less damage when hit with that damage type. It is also possible for a unit to have weakness; if a unit has -100% resistance against a damage type, it will suffer 100% more damage when hit by that type." + _"

For example, Skeletons are highly resistant to Blade and Pierce damage, but are vulnerable to Impact and Fire damage, and extremely vulnerable to Holy damage."

title= _ "Time of Day"
text= _ "Wesnoth games usually take place with a regular cycle between day and night. The current time of day can be observed under the minimap in the upper right.

The time of day affects the damage of certain units as follows -

Chaotic units get +25% damage at night, and -25% in daytime.
Neutral units are unaffected by the time of day." + "

Units have a certain amount of experience required to advance (this is 20% less for units with the Intelligent trait). Once they achieve this amount, they immediately advance to the next level, healing fully in the process. In some cases, you will be given a choice of advancement options." + _"

id=healing
title= _ "Healing"
text= _ "In combat, your units will inevitably take damage. Wesnoth offers several ways for your units to heal, all of which take place at the beginning of your turn, before you take action." + _"

Resting: A unit which neither moves, attacks, nor is attacked will heal 2HP in its next turn." + _"
Villages: A unit which starts a turn in a village will heal 8HP." + _"
<ref>dst=ability_regenerates text=Regeneration</ref>: Certain units (such as trolls) will automatically heal 8HP every turn." + _"
Healing units: Units with the <ref>dst=ability_heals text=Heals</ref> ability will heal all friendly units immediately beside them for 4HP each turn, to a total maximum of 8 points healed, or prevent Poison from dealing damage." + _"

Curing units: Units with the <ref>dst=ability_cures text=Cures</ref> ability will heal all friendly units immediately beside them for 8HP each turn, to a total maximum of 18 points healed, or cure a unit of Poison." + _"

Resting can be combined with other forms of healing, but villages, regeneration, and healing/curing cannot combine with each other. Also, units heal fully between scenarios."

id=income_and_upkeep
title= _ "Income and Upkeep"
text= _ "In Wesnoth, it is not enough simply to recruit units and fight. You must watch your gold as well, especially in campaigns, where you can carry extra gold over from one scenario to the next. There are two aspects to this; Income and Upkeep." + _"

Income is simple. You have a base income of 2 gold per turn. For every village you control, you gain one additional gold each turn. Thus, if you have ten villages, you would normally gain 12 gold each turn. Your Upkeep costs are subtracted from this income, as detailed below." + _"

Upkeep is also fairly simple. Each unit requires an amount of Upkeep equal to its level. You can support as many levels <italic>text=worth</italic> of units as you have villages, without paying any upkeep. However, for each level of unit beyond the number of villages you have, you must pay one gold per turn. For example, if you have twelve level one units and ten villages, you would have to pay two gold each turn in upkeep." + _"

Upkeep costs are subtracted from your Income, so in the case of twelve levels of units and ten villages, your resultant Income would be 10 gold per turn." + _"
There is one important exception to Upkeep: units with the Loyal trait never incur upkeep. Units you begin the scenario with (such as Konrad or Delfador), or units who join you during a scenario (such as the Horseman in the second scenario of Heir to the Throne) will usually have the Loyal trait."

text= _ "Most units have two traits. However, Undead units are assigned the single trait 'Undead', and Woses do not receive any traits. Traits are modifications that change a unit's attributes slightly. They are usually randomly assigned to a unit when it is recruited." + _"

The traits that are available to all non-Undead units are:" + _"


<header>text=Intelligent</header>

Intelligent units require 20% less experience than usual to advance.

Intelligent units are very useful at the beginning of a campaign as they can advance to higher levels more quickly. Later in campaigns Intelligent is not quite as useful because units no longer have any use for experience points after reaching their maximum level. If you have many 'maximum level' units you may wish to recall units with more desirable traits." + _"


<header>text=Quick</header>

Quick units have 1 extra movement point, but 10% less HP than usual.

Quick is the most noticeable trait, particularly in slower moving units such as trolls or heavy infantry. Units with the Quick trait often have greatly increased mobility in rough terrain, so you should consider that when deploying your forces. Also, Quick units aren't quite as tough as units without this trait and are subsequently less good at holding contested positions." + _"


<header>text=Resilient</header>

Resilient units have 7 more HP than usual.

Resilient units can be useful at all stages of a campaign, and this is a useful trait for all units. Resilient is often most helpful as a trait when it occurs in a unit that has some combination of low hitpoints, good defense, or high resistances. Resilient units are especially useful for holding strategic positions against opponents." + _"


<header>text=Strong</header>

Strong units do 1 more damage per swing in melee combat, and have 2 more HP.

While useful for any close-combat unit, Strong is most effective for units who have a high number of swings such as the Elvish Fighter. Strong units can be very useful when a tiny bit of extra damage is all that is needed to turn a damaging stroke into a killing blow." + _"


Other special traits that may be assigned to units are:" + _"


<header>text=Loyal</header>

Loyal units don't incur upkeep. Most units incur an upkeep cost at the end of every turn, which is equal to their level. Loyal units do not incur this cost.


During campaigns, certain units may opt to join the player's forces of their own volition. These units are marked with the Loyal trait. Although they may require payment to be recalled, they never incur any upkeep costs. This can make them invaluable during a long campaign, when gold is in short supply. This trait is never given to recruited units, so it may be unwise to dismiss such units or to send them to a foolish death." + _"


<header>text=Undead</header>

Undead units are immune to poison.

Undead units generally have 'Undead' as their only trait. Since Undead units are the bodies of the dead, risen to fight again, poison has no effect upon them. This can make them invaluable in dealing with foes who use poison in conjunction with their attacks." + _"


<header>text=Dextrous</header>

Dextrous units do +1 damage for every successful strike with a bow.

Dextrous is a trait possessed only by Elves. The Elven people are known for their uncanny grace, and their great facility with the bow. Some, however, are gifted with natural talent that exceeds their brethren. These elves inflict an additional point of damage with each arrow."

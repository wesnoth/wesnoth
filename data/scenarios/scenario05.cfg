		message=During the reign of Garard I, your uncle's father, the dwarves of Knalga agreed to make the king a magnificent scepter. It took their finest smiths years to make it. But soon after it was completed, Orcs invaded the tunnels of Knalga. Now Knalga is in chaos, and though some Dwarves still live in parts of it, always at war with the Orcs, the sceptre was lost somewhere in the great caverns.

Other than that, recalled units are basically like recruited units, except that instead of a new unit appearing, a unit from a previous scenario will appear.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How should I decide which units to recall?") (_"You should usually recall units that have already advanced to the next level. However, you may also want to recall units that have high experience, and are thus likely to advance. You should recall units that will be useful for the scenario you are in; for example in a forest scenario, recall elves.")}

This is done by randomly assigning each unit traits when they are recruited. The traits that a unit has are displayed on the Status Table, and the function of a specific trait can be found by putting your cursor over that trait.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What kind of traits can my units get?") (_"There are five distinct traits, which have effects ranging from increasing a unit's hit points to decreasing the amount of XP required to advance. However all traits are designed to improve unit's power; there are no 'negative' traits. Most units have an equal chance to get any two different traits when they are recruited.")}

The cost of recalling a unit is always 20 gold. A unit also costs gold for each turn it is under your control. This cost, called 'upkeep', is equal to the level of the unit. However, units you do not recruit or recall such as your leader do not cost any gold at all. The total upkeep cost of your units is displayed on the status bar at the top after a picture of gold and then a red arrow.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I get gold?") (_"You begin each scenario with a percentage of gold from the previous scenario. If this is less than 100 gold, you begin with 100 gold instead. The amount of gold you have is displayed on the status bar after the picture of gold. After the start of a scenario, you receive 2 gold every turn. Since you usually need more gold than that, you should flag villages, which give you 1 gold per turn.")}

During day, units of the alignment Lawful, such as humans, do 25% more damage, while Chaotic units such as undead do 25% less. At night it is reversed. During twilight, all units do their normal damage. Neutral units such as elves are unaffected by day and night.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I know what time of day it is?") (_"The times of day usually progress in a sequence: dawn- identical to twilight, morning- day, evening- day, dusk- twilight, first-watch- night, second-watch- night, then repeat. This is represented by the sun and moon which each rise in the east and set in the west. However some scenarios have a different sequence, such as underground where it is perpetually night. You can find out the current time of day by looking at the Status Table.")}

{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What are the different properties that terrains have?") (_"Two terrains have properties which have already been described; namely villages and castle. However the properties of most terrains are more subtle, and have to do with the advantages and disadvantages different units have when they move onto them. The first property of a terrain is the number of move points it takes each unit to move through the hex. The second property is the defense that the terrain gives units standing on it. This is a percentage which determines the unit's chance to be hit on that terrain. For example; many elves have 70% defense in woods, and are therefore hit 30% of the time.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I find out the properties of a specific terrain?") (_"To find out the properties of a terrain with respect to a specific unit, right-click on the unit, select Unit Description, then look at Terrain Modifiers. To find out which terrain is on a particular hex, move your cursor over that hex and look in the upper-right hand corner of the screen. This will display, in order, the name of the terrain, then the coordinates of the hex, then the selected unit's defense, then the number of move points it will cost the selected unit to move through that hex.")}

{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How does resistance affect attack damage?") (_"Each unit has a certain resistance against each attack type. This resistance is a percentage which is subtracted from the damage of opponent's weapons of that type. For example, if an Elvish Scout is attacked by an Elvish Archer, the archer does 20% more damage than normal, since Elvish Scouts have -20% resistance to pierce. This bonus/penalty is calculated additively with other bonuses/penalties like time of day, so two -50% penalties would add up to -100%.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What are the different damage types?") (_"There are 6 different damage types: blade, pierce, impact, fire, cold, and holy. Heavily armored units have high resistance to the physical types: blade, pierce, and impact, but low resistance to the magical types: fire and cold. All living units have resistance to holy while undead are extremely weak to it. To find out a specific unit's resistance, right-click on the unit, select Unit Description, then look at Resistances.")}

{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What do specialties do?") (_"Each specialty does something different; that's the whole point of a specialty. To find a description of a unit's specialty, put your cursor over the name of the specialty.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"Which units get specialties?") (_"The specialties a unit gets are determined by the unit type; for example all generals have the specialty leadership. There are two kinds of specialties: abilities, and attack specials. Abilities apply to units while attack specials only apply to one of the unit's attacks.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"What kinds of specialties can my units get?") (_"There are many different specialties, and learning about them is one of the interesting parts of playing Wesnoth. The two most common specialties are called 'magical' and 'leadership'. Magical attacks have a 70% chance of hitting enemies regardless of what terrain they are on. Units do more damage while next to a unit of higher level with leadership.")}
{QUESTION_OPTION (_"How do I use specialties?") (_"To use a specialty, you just have to move and/or attack with your units in a way which triggers the specialty. For example, in order to use leadership, you must move a unit with leadership next to another unit, then attack with the other unit.")}

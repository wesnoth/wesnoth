    # provide different font orders: one just has to install the missing fonts
    # or add them to wesnoth/fonts.

    # Pango text-related keys.

    # All respective font files are automatically loaded.
    #
    # NOTE: these are technically supposed to be lists to provide fallbacks
    # like the SDL_TTF code does. However, there's a weird bug in Pango itself
    # where a comma seperated list of fonts will result in newlines not being
    # rendered and font space metrics being off on Windows.
    #
    # Additionally, despite what one might assume, "Lato" doesn't appear to
    # load all Lato font variants (it has a bunch of different weight ones).
    # I had thought one could specify different weights and Pango would
    # automatically use the variant for that weight, but no dice. Instead, we
    # need to set the weight variant we want as the distired font familt at
    # render time. Right now we only have use of a "light" variant, but others
    # could be added at some point.

# This module handles events attached to four villages outside oasis not near necromancer fort. Scenario assumes that
# there is a chance to find an unit in each of them unless they have been captured by undead already.

#! -- Internal variables :
# $i, $outer_villages[]{4 sets of coordinates}
#! -- Depends on :
# $elf_pool[], $elf_pool_counter
#! -- Clears :
# $elf_pool[], $elf_pool_counter

# For each village we need to prepare a pair of events, one in case it's initialy captured by player and one in case
# it's ransacked by bad guys. Because it needs to be done before play starts, we're going to use 'start' event.

[event]
    name=start

    # There is a number of houses inside the oasis and even more tents by the necromancers fort, we need to make sure
    # that these are ignored. To do this we store coordinates ([store_locations]) of all desert villages (Dd^Vt) that
    # are not ([not]) within rectangle defined by points 40,1 60,12 (x=40-60, y=1-12) or ([or]) rectangle defined by 22,24 43,34 .
    # First rectangle includes all villages near necromancer, the second covers whole oasis. These coordinates are stored to
    # array called outer_villages (variable=outer_villages).

    # Now for each stored set of coordinates we need to prepare a capture event that can be triggered both by good and bad guys.
    # To do this we declare an iterator.

    # And use foreach macro, that simulates an loop walking over an array from beginning to end.

       31,11 at the end of The Bay of Pearls, causing it to disappear
       forever.

   * Legend of Wesmere:
     * Fixed missing journey map background in story screens.
   * Son of the Black Eye:

 * Language and i18n:

 * Multiplayer:
   * Fix for bug #21405, in a series of features:
     * The abort option presented to the host when a player disconnects
       from a networked game is now a "save and abort" option.
     * New Idle controller status: Sides may now be set in an "idle" state
       by the host when a player disconnects from a network game. This does
       not give any player control or vision. To proceed with the game, the
       host must reassign the side's controller using :control, :droid, or
       :give_control as usual. (give_control existed but was not documented)
       Related to this, there are new commands :controller which query the
       controller status, and :idle which toggles the idle status.
     * New "Blindfold Replays" option: Observers may check a box in the
       lobby so that if they join a game, they will be "blindfolded" and see
       only a black screen until they are given control of a side.

     screenshot was successfully saved to disk, including options to open it
     in an external application, copy the path to clipboard, or browse the
     screenshots folder.
   * Force grayscale antialiasing for text rendered using Cairo/Pango (e.g. by
     GUI2) on Windows to work around ClearType-induced glitches (bug #21648).
   * Added descriptions to the options in Preferences -> Display -> Themes.

 * Miscellaneous and bug fixes:
   * Users now get a warning if they start a multiplayer scenario through the
     title screen load button, as this may cause eras and modifications not
     to work correctly in subsequent scenarios of an mp campaign.

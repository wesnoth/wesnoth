     than the default damage calculation method.

       :give_control as usual. (give_control existed but was not documented)
       Related to this, there are new commands :controller which query the
       controller status, and :idle which toggles the idle status.

      better on large resolutions. Not fully completed, so it doesn't look
      perfect yet.
    * Added a blur effect to most ingame dialogs.

     replay and whether to delete autosaves have been replaced by user

     target from multiple directions; the last highlighted adjacent hex now
     marks the direction to move to and attack from.
   * The third annoying end-of-scenario prompt, asking if you want to save
     an image of a new scenario immediately before entering it, is now only
     presented if the game was built with TINY_GUI.  Non-tiny systems do this
     automatically without asking.
